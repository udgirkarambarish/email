Were donating 1 million to support online freedom and democracy,"Proton( Community update Dear Proton supporter, Since 2018, we have donated over 4 million to support nonprofits( aligned with Protons mission of privacy and freedom. While many organizations claim to champion these values, at Proton we believe actions speak louder than words and were the only encrypted email and VPN company that puts large amounts of money to back this up. Thanks to the overwhelming success of the 2024 Lifetime charity fundraiser, this year, were making our largest contribution ever( at over 1 million dollars. This money is going to over a dozen nonprofits defending freedom and privacy that were selected by you. Some, like Free Press Unlimited, defend independent journalism, while others, like the Tech Oversight Project, support Protons longstanding efforts to combat the destructive influence of Big Tech. Dr. Andy Yen Founder, Proton A privacy analysis of RedNote, the trending TikTok alternative Following news of a TikTok ban in the US, many people are switching to a Chinese-owned alternative known as RedNote. But just like TikTok and many other social media apps, RedNote presents major risks to your privacy. The app monitors your location, browsing history, messages, and more. See our analysis to learn how to protect yourself( Big Tech fines dont work because theyre making billions In 2024, governments worldwide imposed a record 8.2 billion in fines on Big Tech companies like Apple, Google, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft. But for these tech giants, the penalties are barely noticeable. According to our analysis of Big Tech revenues, Google can pay off its 3 billion in fines in just 17 days of business, and Amazon wiped out its 57 million penalty in a day. These fines are little more than a cost of doing business for Big Tech, failing to deter their anti-competitive practices and privacy abuses. To hold these companies accountable, regulators must shift their focus from symbolic penalties to structural changes. Read how fines fall short and what needs to happen for real accountability( Toward internet privacy for all in 2025 To succeed in our mission, we must build encrypted services that are simple and seamless for anyone to use, no matter your tech abilities. So, in 2025, were doubling down on making Proton a complete alternative to Big Tech because end-to-end encryption works best when everyone is using it.

21 Years of Notepad; Modules Vs. Microservices,"View this post on the web at Welcome to HackerPulse Dispatch, your weekly newsletter that curates major developments in the tech world! From market trends to tech news and groundbreaking innovations, weve got it all coveredwith byte-sized insights delivered straight to your inbox. Heres what new: Celebrating 21 Years of Notepad: The Legendary Journey of Our Favorite Text Editor Alright, folks, gather around because its story time about Notepad celebrating 21 years as a trusted, feature-rich text editor, beloved by developers, writers, and users. Linus Torvalds Lands A 2.6% Performance Improvement With Minor Linux Kernel Patch Learn about Linus Torvalds' latest patch, bringing a 2.6% performance boost to the Linux kernel by optimizing the 64-bit copyfromuser() function, reducing overhead and enhancing system efficiency. Why Sprints Are Taking the Joy Out of Building Software Explore how rethinking sprints can transform team productivity and morale, moving from rushed cycles to balanced workflows that prioritize quality and creativity. Aliaksandr Valialkin on X Explore the rising influence of bots in software development, where a staggering 41% of comments in GitHub issues and 33% of git pushes are now generated by automated tools, reshaping the landscape of coding and collaboration. You Want Modules, Not Microservices Let's dissect the microservices trend to uncover its historical roots, the emphasis on organizational clarity, and the challenges of distributed computing that shape its impact on modern software development. Celebrating 21 Years of Notepad: The Legendary Journey of Our Favorite Text Editor ( Read the Story ) One of the most underrated yet indispensable tools in the digital worldNotepad celebrates 21 years as a trusted, feature-rich text editor. It marked its place as a true MVP for developers, writers, and anyone whos ever needed a dependable place to jot things down. From groundbreaking features to community love, Notepad has earned its stripes, and then some. Key Points The early days: back to 2003s roots: In a world before YouTube or iPhones, Don Ho created Notepad with a simple goalto be powerful yet lightweight. built on Scintilla and written in C, it quickly became a game-changer for efficiency-minded users. Feature-packed & flexible: Whether its multi-document tabbing, syntax highlighting, or thousands of plugins, Notepad is both straightforward and sophisticated. need JSON readability or FTP integration? Notepad has a plugin for that. Community-powered legacy: Staying relevant for two decades, Notepad thrives not on corporate backing but through its passionate open-source community. with countless contributions, its a tool built by its users, for its usersone well happily use for years to come. Linus Torvalds Lands A 2.6% Performance Improvement With Minor Linux Kernel Patch ( Read the Story ) This week, Linus Torvalds merged a new patch that promises a 2.6% performance boost for the Linux kernel, specifically within Intels will it scale per-thread-ops benchmark. The update tweaks the 64-bit copyfromuser() function, bypassing the slower barriernospec() to reduce overhead. This may sound like a small optimization, but every little improvement counts, especially in kernel performance. Lets dive into the details of this recent change. Key Points Targeted optimization: The patch, inspired by an earlier proposal by kernel developer Josh Poimboeuf, focuses on using pointer masking instead of barriernospec() to streamline data transfer from user-space to kernel-space. Benchmark results: With testing showing a 2.6% improvement in per-thread operations, this change could benefit both synthetic and real-world workloads, offering better performance without the spectre-mitigation overhead. Upcoming release: Merged into the Linux Git repository, this patch will appear in the Linux 6.12-rc6 release next Sunday, with a stable Linux 6.12 release expected later this month. Why Sprints Are Taking the Joy Out of Building Software ( Read the Story ) Software development teams often feel like they're stuck in a marathon disguised as a sprintrushing through task after task, barely catching their breath before diving into the next cycle. While sprints are meant to embody the Agile spirit, some argue theyve become a source of stress, focusing more on deadlines than quality and creativity. Lets debunk the myth that sprints are essential to Agile and explore alternative workflows that encourage balance, productivity, and well-being. From companies like Basecamp to smaller teams, examples show theres more than one way to organize work effectively. Key Points Rethinking sprints: Rather than emphasizing sprints, teams could focus on creating flexible, quality-driven cycleslike Basecamps six-week work periods followed by a cooldown phase for fixing and personal projects. Alternative approaches: Smaller teams and even established companies like Basecamp show that releasing when features are ready, without rigid timelines, can result in thoughtful, high-quality output. Making small changes: Even if youre in a sprint-heavy environment, you can leave breathing room in sprints, skip unnecessary meetings, and occasionally dedicate entire sprints to quality improvementsincremental adjustments that can enhance team productivity and morale. Aliaksandr Valialkin on X ( Read the Story ) In a recent analysis, Aliaksandr Valialkin highlighted the significant role of bots in GitHub's activity, revealing just how automated the coding world has become. According to his findings, a remarkable portion of GitHub interactionsespecially comments, commits, and pull requestsare bot-generated, a trend largely driven by tools like Dependabot. This shift towards automation raises important questions about the future of coding and collaboration in open-source projects. Key Points Comments: Bots accounted for 41% of all comments on GitHub issues, reflecting automation's heavy hand in keeping conversations active and relevant. Commits: About 33% of all git pushes were generated by bots, showing the extent to which automation supports software development. Pull Requests: Over 30% of public pull requests in recent months were bot-driven, with Dependabot leading in creating and managing dependency updates. You Want Modules, Not Microservices (Read the Story ) In software architecture, microservices have emerged as a hot topic, hailed as the ultimate solution for scalability and developer focus. However, as we dive deeper into this trend, it becomes evident that the benefits touted by microservices are not entirely new concepts; they have roots in decades-old practices. This analysis aims to unravel the true essence of microservices, shedding light on both their merits and the challenges they present, as well as how they relate to the broader context of software development. Key Points Not a new concept: Many advantages associated with microservices, such as scalability and reliability, have been discussed for years in the context of earlier technologies like EJB and Oracle Tuxedo. By recognizing this historical pattern, we can better understand the motivations behind the current microservices trend. Organizational clarity: Microservices are more about promoting independent development teams than about architectural principles. The emphasis is on reducing dependencies that slow down progress, allowing teams to own their entire workflow, from coding to deployment, and adapt quickly to changes. Fallacies of distributed computing: While microservices aim to improve performance and scalability, they also introduce new challenges related to latency and communication across distributed systems. Understanding these pitfalls is crucial for teams considering a transition to a microservices architecture, as the complexities can outweigh the perceived benefits. And that's a wrap!

"Microsofts New OpenHCL, OOPs Power & 3 More","View this post on the web at Welcome to HackerPulse Dispatch, your weekly slice of the latest news and trends in the tech world! Heres what new: How Is This Website So Fast!? Breaking down the McMaster Carr Website and the Techniques They Use to Make It So Dang Fast: In a world where slow-loading websites mean lost sales, McMaster-Carr is proving that speed doesnt always require the latest tech. Microsoft Has Open Sourced Its New Cross-Platform Virtual Machine Layer Written in Rust: Meet Microsofts new open-source paravisor, OpenHCL, enhances virtualization for confidential computing by enabling secure VM workloads without frequent OS updates. Software Engineer Titles Have (Almost) Lost All Their Meaning: The inflation of software engineer titles is eroding career clarity and industry integrity, creating mismatched expectations and undermining authentic growth. Using AI Generated Code Will Make You a Bad Programmer: Did you know that the reliance on AI-generated code undermines personal growth, devalues programming skills, and leads to a lack of respect from peers? OOP Is Not That Bad, Actually: Explore the essential strengths of mainstream statically-typed Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), promoting backward compatibility and flexibility in collaborative coding. How Is This Website So Fast!? Breaking down the McMaster Carr Website and the Techniques They Use to Make It So Dang Fast ( Read the Story ) When Kenneth Cassel, founder of rmfg.com, tweeted about McMaster-Carrs surprisingly snappy online shopping experience, it sparked a lively debate on Twitter. For those unfamiliar with the century-old industrial supplies company, McMaster-Carr has been quietly excelling at customer experience for decadesranked just behind Amazon and Barnes & Noble back in 2002. But whats catching attention now is how the site combines old-school design with cutting-edge performance, defying modern web trends. Key Points Old tools, new tricks: McMaster-Carrs site runs on ASP.NET with JavaScript powered by jQuery and the vintage YUI librarytechnology many consider outdated, yet performing exceptionally well. Under the hood: Key optimizations, like server-side rendering, prefetching links, and CDN caching, ensure users experience lightning-fast interactions without modern bloat. A lesson for the web: McMaster-Carrs success shows that practical performance engineering beats trendy frameworksreminding us that websites dont need flashiness to impress. Microsoft Has Open Sourced Its New Cross-Platform Virtual Machine Layer Written in Rust ( Read the Story ) Virtualization has been the backbone of cloud computing from the start, allowing workloads to run efficiently in virtual machines (VMs). Now, Microsoft is pushing the boundaries with a novel solution called the ""paravisor,"" aimed at addressing the limitations of confidential computing. Microsofts new open-source paravisor, OpenHCL, embedded within the VMs secure boundary, ensures that both older and newer operating systems can leverage confidential computing without frequent updates or disruptions. Key Points OpenHCL: unified solution for all VMs: OpenHCL bridges the gap between confidential and non-confidential VMs, offering device emulation, performance enhancements, and compatibility for legacy OS versions without requiring modifications. Collaborative hardware support: OpenHCL already supports Intel TDX, AMD SEV-SNP, and ARM CCA, with ongoing collaboration to optimize performance across multiple architectures. Future-proof innovation: Microsoft aims to expand OpenHCLs reach by supporting KVM hosts and aligning it with community-driven projects, ensuring adaptability for the future of confidential computing. Software Engineer Titles Have (Almost) Lost All Their Meaning ( Read the Story ) The title of ""Senior Software Engineer"" once carried weight, signaling deep expertise, years of hands-on experience, and a readiness to lead. However, in recent years, title inflation has run rampant, leaving the industry grappling with a devaluation of roles. Developers with only a few years of experience are being given senior titles, diluting what those titles once represented and muddling the path for career growth. The problem isnt just confusingits reshaping industry dynamics, creating mismatches between expectations and real-world abilities. Key Points Misaligned expectations: With inflated titles, junior employees are often thrust into responsibilities theyre unprepared for, leading to poor performance, burnout, and team disruptions. A lack of clarity in role expectations hurts not only those employees but also the teams they lead. Toward authentic growth frameworks: Leaders and HR teams must prioritize transparent career paths tied to skills and responsibilities, rather than resorting to hollow titles. Companies that resist title inflation cultivate stronger teams, attract top talent, and build reputations rooted in trust and excellence. Using AI Generated Code Will Make You a Bad Programmer (Read the Story ) In a provocative opinion piece, Rudis Muiznieks critiques the reliance on AI-generated code, arguing that it undermines personal growth and the integrity of programming as a craft. While AI tools can streamline mundane tasks, the author contends that over-dependence on them not only stifles learning but also fosters a culture of superficial coding without genuine understanding. Key Points Developers rob themselves of learning opportunities: Relying on AI-generated code limits growth and understanding, akin to ""script kiddies"" who use pre-written tools without grasping their functionality. Skills developers already have may atrophy: Regularly writing code, even the boring bits, is essential to maintaining and improving programming skills, as neglect leads to forgetfulness and diminished abilities. Developers code will not be respected: Using AI tools may result in a lack of respect from peers, as true pride and accomplishment in programming come from creating code independently. OOP Is Not That Bad, Actually ( Read the Story ) In a recent post, the author reflects on the merits of mainstream statically-typed Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), arguing that it offers essential advantages for collaborative programming over extended periods. While the author may not favor the OOP paradigm, they acknowledge that certain features are crucial for developing composable libraries and maintaining backward compatibility. Through a comparative analysis with Haskell, the author aims to illustrate that OOP is often misjudged by functional programmers. Key Points OOP provides essential features: The core features of OOP, such as classes, inheritance, subtyping, and virtual calls, enable developers to create flexible and maintainable code that can evolve without disrupting existing functionality. Backward compatibility is key: The OOP approach allows developers to extend libraries with new functionalities while ensuring that existing code remains functional, fostering an environment conducive to collaboration and long-term projects. Functional programming needs to embrace OOP successes: The author advocates for the functional programming community to recognize the successful aspects of OOP, emphasizing that understanding these strengths can lead to better practices in the industry. And that's a wrap! Tune in for the biggest hits from the tech world."

"September Changelog: Maintenance mode, Environment isolation, Manual service previews","--- We'd love to hear about your experience with Render! Let us know whats working and where we can improve. It's quick, we promise: --- Hey everyone, Today we're highlighting updates that expand your operational controls for networking, logging, database storage, and more. Let's take a look: Opt in to flexible PostgreSQL plans Our new flexible PostgreSQL plans offer many more compute and storage choices and will be available very soon. You can access the new plans right now by following these steps: Create previews only for specific pull requests Service previews and preview environments are fantastic for testing code changes, but not every change needs a preview. To save costs, you can now spin up previews only for PRs with render preview in their title. See the docs: Block private network traffic between environments Organize your services into different environments, then isolate those environments from each other on your private network. Now, you can ensure your staging apps never write to a production database (or vice versa). See the docs: Pause inbound requests with maintenance mode Making complex backend changes that require downtime? You can now let your users know simply by turning on maintenance mode. Serve Render's default maintenance page to your users or specify your own. See the docs: Customize log streaming for individual services If you use log streams to forward logs to a provider like Datadog, you can now customize the behavior for each service: - Professional workspaces can disable log streaming for individual services. - Organization and Enterprise workspaces can set a custom log stream destination for individual services. See the docs: Get to know our team - Near San Francisco? Join us this Friday evening for a developer meetup hosted by Render and our friends at WorkOS. RSVP here: - Anywhere else?

Is AI Generating Chaos in Businesses?,"View this post on the web at Heres what new: Stop Designing Your Web Application for Millions of Users When You Dont Even Have 100: Explore why you should build for today, not tomorrow, and focus on your first 100 users before worrying about scaling for millions. How Discord Reduced Websocket Traffic by 40%: Discord's engineering team turbocharged mobile performance by switching to zstandard compression, boosting speed and reducing data usage. AI-Generated Code is Causing Outages and Security Issues in Businesses: Businesses using AI for coding are experiencing downtime and security issues due to insufficient code reviews and accountability. Correlation Does Not Imply Causation: Understanding the difference between correlation and causation is crucial for making informed decisions, as misinterpretations can lead to misguided actions based on spurious relationships in data. The Arrival of Java 23: Oracle has launched JDK 23, featuring twelve enhancements, including new language features and improved performance with the Z Garbage Collector. Stop Designing Your Web Application for Millions of Users When You Dont Even Have 100 ( Read Paper ) Its easy to get caught up in building for the future, imagining millions of users and endless growth. But if you're still trying to land your first 100 users, preparing for scale may be premature. Over-engineering early on can cost you valuable time, money, and focus. Instead, its best to prioritize the present. Heres why scaling later is smarter than over-preparing now. Key Points Dont design on assumptions: In the early stages, you're guessing at what users need. Focus on delivering real value now and worry about scale once you have clear data from your user base. Over-engineering is wasted time: Time spent building for millions is time taken away from refining your product. Build for your current users and adjust as you grow. Costs pile up fast: Investing in large-scale infrastructure before it's necessary drains resources. Use that money on development and user acquisition instead. How Discord Reduced Websocket Traffic by 40% ( Read Paper ) Over the last six months, Discords engineering team embarked on a journey to reduce bandwidth usage for mobile clients, specifically iOS and Android. With the hope that this would create a smoother, more responsive user experience, the team explored new methods of compression that could minimize data usage. Key Points Initial Testing with zstandard: Discord tested zstandard but found its performance underwhelming compared to zlib, later identifying the lack of streaming compression as the root cause. Dark Launches and Experimentation: By conducting dark launches and exploring zstandards streaming features, Discord achieved better compression ratios and faster performance across clients. Dictionary Support Challenges: Although adding dictionary support gave mixed results, Discord ultimately succeeded in rolling out zstandard across all platforms, improving connections for both mobile and desktop users. AI-Generated Code is Causing Outages and Security Issues in Businesses ( Read Paper ) As more businesses turn to AI for coding, concerns over its reliability are growing. Tariq Shaukat, CEO of Sonar, is hearing firsthand how companies using AI code generation are encountering downtime and security risks. Studies show AI often makes mistakes, with even major institutions falling victim to inconsistent code quality. Key Points Ai-generated code issues: Businesses are facing outages due to AI-generated code, especially in critical systems. While AI speeds up coding, it often leads to bugs and security vulnerabilities. Review practices: Developers are conducting fewer reviews of AI-written code, which increases security risks. A lack of robust quality control processes makes systems unstable. Developer mindset: Many developers feel less accountable for buggy AI code, blaming the tools instead. This detachment can lead to critical errors going unnoticed and causing significant disruptions. Correlation Does Not Imply Causation ( Read Paper ) Key Points Correlation vs. causation: Correlation is a statistical measure that indicates a relationship between two variables, but it does not imply that one causes the other. Misunderstanding this can lead to faulty conclusions. Spurious correlations: Spurious correlations occur when two variables appear related but lack a real-world connection. These coincidences can mislead decision-makers if not critically evaluated. The Arrival of Java 23 ( Read Paper ) Oracle is excited to announce the general availability of JDK 23, bringing significant enhancements to developers, enterprises, and end-users. With twelve noteworthy JDK Enhancement Proposals (JEPs), this release introduces eight preview features and one incubator feature, showcasing improvements in the Java language, APIs, and performance tools. The inclusion of the Oracle GraalVM JIT compiler enhances the JDK's capabilities, providing developers with advanced performance optimization tools. Key Points Language improvements: JDK 23 introduces several key language enhancements, such as primitive types in patterns and a new module import declaration, simplifying the code and making it more accessible for beginners. Performance upgrades: The Z Garbage Collector now operates in generational mode by default, significantly improving performance in most use cases based on feedback and testing. Tooling enhancements: The new Markdown document comments feature allows developers to use Markdown for writing Javadoc documentation, making it easier to read and understand. And that's a wrap! Until next time, frens"

What you don't understand about equity is:,"The Startup Newsletter - January 25th, 2024 March 21st, 2024 Subscribe ( ) March 21st, 2024 Subscribe ( ) Slidebean ( ) The difference between struggle and success?

Subscribe now! ( ) The one thing founders dont understand about startup equity If youre a startup founder, youve heard this for years: the percentage of the company you own is essential. Startup equity and ownership play crucial roles, but it might shock you when I say founders get this wrong. Sadly, most founders don't correctly understand equity because they see it all wrong. Most founders see startup equity as a pie chart, but a pie chart is an overly simplified approach to a company. Though it may be tougher to grasp, theres another, better way to look at a startup. What do startup founders get wrong about equity? Lets use two business types as examples: an LLC and a C-Corp. Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) protect their owners from responsibility should the company have debts or liabilities, hence the name. An LLC is like a partnership and is usually split in percentages, so its closer to the pie chart example we used earlier. Each partner has a determined percentage of the company. However, most startups aren't LLCs. Instead, they are C-corporations, a legal structure in which the owners, or shareholders, are taxed separately from the entity. Heres a new, essential term: shareholders. They're vital for a startup, and thats when it all changes. Instead of seeing startups like a pie chart, viewing them as bricks is better. How do startups split their shares? The first thing to understand is that startup equity doesn't work in percentages but in company shares. For example, Founder A and Founder B create and split one company equally. Each gets ten shares, and the percentages are 50% for each. Neither founders shares ever change hands. Instead, the company will create new shares if an investor comes in. Both founders still have ten shares, and investor C will get new shares. So, the shares remain the same, but the percentages change. Founders A and B will no longer own 50% of the company, though each still has ten shares. Thats where valuation plays a crucial role in defining how much percentage the investor gets. Startup valuations and how they impact shares Startup valuations are easier to understand using Facebook as an example. When Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin started Facebook, they agreed to a 70/30 split on their founder equity. Peter Thiel was one of the first investors in Facebook. He agreed to give them 510,000, which would eventually become approximately 10% of the company. However, startups deal with shares, not percentages. So, 510,000 has to equate to some shares. The question is: how many? When Thiel decided to invest, Facebook had no revenue or assets. That's why valuations relate to the company's potential. A startup valuation is like betting odds: agreeing on how much to risk and what the reward will be if the investor, in this case, Thiel, is right. Its the risk hes willing to take. Founders usually keep most of the shares for motivation and security. So, it's common for investors to get a small part of the company first. With Facebook, Zuckerberg and Thiel agreed that 10% of the company equated to around 500,000. If 500,000 is 10% of the company, the entire company is worth 5,000,000. That's the post-money valuation because it's assuming the money is already part of the business. On the other hand, pre-money valuation is the estimated value of a company before investor money is involved, which in Facebooks case was 4,500,000. We actually made a video explaining how Facebook's equity shifted and changed during their early days: ( ) Using Facebook as an example for startup equity Let's assume that Mark Zuckerberg, Eduardo Saverin, and the rest established the company with 100 shares. Since the companys pre-money is 4,500,000, each share is worth 45,000. So, Thiels 500,000 is enough to buy 11 shares (495,000. These are rough estimates). Facebook creates the shares and sells them to Peter Thiel. Now, the company has 111 shares, and Peter owns 9,9% of those shares. Eduardo Saverin originally had 30 shares, which equated to 30%. He still has the 30 shares, but their value has dropped to around 27%. Shares usually dont change over time, but the percentage they represent gets smaller as more shares get created. The same applies to startup stock options. So, how do startup stock options work? First, lets clear one thing: giving stock options doesnt mean employees get shares in the business. Rather, itsthe option to buy them at a pre-determined price called a ""strike price."" Let's say Facebook gave one employee the option of buying 30,000 shares at a strike price of 0.89. When Facebook went public, the price per share was 38. So, stock option owners could buy for 0.89 and then sell for 38, netting massive profits. Stock options are enticing and advantageous as long as the company increases in value. That's why companies love increasing their valuation, but it doesn't always turn out well. At one point, WeWork was worth 47 billion, and we all know what happened.

"Impossible Cubes, Liminal Bytes, and Candy Toggles",".content .byline That .byline selector probably doesnt gain anything by being nested like that. Break it out of there and itll be more re-usable and easier to override if you need to. But this: .card container (width 60ch) Is probably good! It just saves you from having to re-write the .card selector again. Scott gets more in-depth though with more examples and I largely agree. How do you adjust an existing color light and darker? Im a biiiig fan of the relative color syntax , which is great at this job, but before I go on a tangent about that, its not well supported yet so lets not. Its on the Interop 2024 list though! Better supported is color-mix() , and Cory LaViska has the story on using it for this job : Using color-mix() , we can adjust the tint/shade based on the background color, meaning we dont need to manually select lighter/darker colors for those states. And because were using OKLCH, the variations will be perceptually uniform, unlike HSL . By mixing white and black into colors, and doing it in the OKLCH color space, we can essentially tint and shade the colors and know that were doing it evenly across any color we have. This is as opposed to the days when a lot of us tried to use darken() and such in Sass only to find extremely different results across colors. How are the final values of Custom Properties calculated? Stephanie Eckles: Custom properties aka CSS variables seem fairly straightforward. However, there are some behaviors to be aware of regarding how the browser computes the final values. A misunderstanding of this process may lead to an unexpected or missing value and difficulty troubleshooting and resolving the issue. Custom Properties follow the cascade and are computed at runtime, for one thing, which is the whole reason that they cannot be preprocessed ahead of time. But its more complex than that. What if the value is valid for a custom property (most anything is), but not valid for the way you are trying to use it? This is a real head scratcher: html color: red; p color: blue; .card --color: notacolor; .card p color: var(--color); Turns out .card p will actually be red (I would have guessed blue), but Stephanie explains: The .card p will be the inherited color value of red as provided by the body . It is unable to use the cascaded value of blue due to the browser discarding that as a possible value candidate at parse time when it is only evaluating syntax. How do you accommodate people who struggle with transparent interfaces? Adam Argyle explains it can be like this , using this media query you may or may not have heard of: .example --opacity: 0.5; background: hsl(200 100% 50% / var(--opacity)); media (prefers-reduced-transparency: reduce) --opacity: 0.95; Adam had lots of practical examples in the post, and does consider that word reduced , and how it doesnt mean absolutely none ever . What units should you use for spacing properties? Me, I just use rem usually as thats what I use for nearly everything else. But Ashlee M Boyer argues that while stuff like text makes good sense to use relative units, spacing need not scale at that same rate: When a user is customizing their viewing experience, they thing thats most important to them and their task at hand is the content. Spacing isnt often vital for a user to perform their task, so it doesnt need to grow or scale at the same rate as the content itself. When spacing between content grows, it eats up vital real estate and becomes harder to manage. Ashlee proves it with a before video and an after video , after being moving relative units to absolute units for spacing. How do you make every Sass file automatically include common imports? This one hits home for me, as someone with a codebase with easily hundreds of Sass files that all start with something like import ""codepen/variables""; Wouldnt it be cool if Sass could just assume we wanted to do that for every file? Austin Gil covered this a while back on doing it with Vite . When you define your Vite config, you can like: css: preprocessorOptions: scss: additionalData: import ""/assets/shared.scss"";;"

Despite the promise of blockchain in supply chains, its adoption is hindered ( ) by unfamiliarity, scalability issues, regulatory hurdles, and cost concerns. New startup Sierra aims to revolutionize customer experience ( ) using AI agents to improve interactions with digital brands. Database firm MariaDB could go private in a 37M deal ( ) following a provisional offer from K1 Investment Management. Lightspeed India Partners' Lift Off summit shines a spotlight on India's rebound in startup funding ( ) despite industry challenges. Become your own CFO: The key to mastering your company's finances ( ) As a CEO you have one job: dont run out of money. We teach you how to achieve this in three months with our custom course. The next cohort begins March 18th. Join us! Join the next cohort ( ) The battle for truth: how AI startups are fighting election interference ( ) AI startups are increasingly engaged in politics, and with roughly 49% of the global population heading to the polls ( ) , the issue takes on significant importance on the global agenda. Anthropic, an AI startup, is piloting a feature to combat election misinformation. Their technology, ""Prompt Shield,"" identifies when users of its GenAI chatbot, Claude, ask about political topics, and redirects them to ""authoritative"" sources for voting data. The move stems from Claude's limitations in providing up-to-date political information. This shift is part of a larger trend in the AI industry to curb election interference. Similar efforts are in play at OpenAI which prohibits the use of its tools for political campaigning. The stakes are high, globally, with a record number of voters heading to the polls this year. The use of GenAI tools in political campaigns remains a contentious issue and, in the U.S., regulation is yet to catch up. This self-regulation by AI companies underscores the growing realization of the potential misuse of AI technology in politics. ( ) Policymakers, platform owners, and AI developers should be vigilant in ensuring responsible usage and deployment of AI tools.

Dive into the real work behind startup funding, understand investor expectations, and how to prepare for success. Essential viewing for founders seeking venture capital. Our new Startup Club Newsletter ( ) goes out twice a week, and it coveres the state of startup fundraising, and the stories that are capturing interest from investors. Join the Club ( ) 2024, its in the game! ( ) Advancing through levels in a video game requires as much skill as it does hope. Those two characteristics are present in venture capital investors envisioning a more promising 2024 for the video game industry. While it's true that there were better years than 2023 for startups in this industry, considering fundraising compared to previous years, that doesn't diminish investors' confidence. They consider significant milestones from last year ( ) , such as releasing relevant titles like Baldur's Gate 3 and Hogwarts Legacy (each selling over 22 million copies). The industry is shifting towards cross-platform games ( ) , which, while expensive, are also more lucrative. Another point in favor is the availability of talent in the market, considering the number of developers available after mass layoffs in other areas in 2023. Adding to this is the integration of artificial intelligence to continue advancing game development and innovation. Could 2024 be when the gaming industry jumps to the next level?

Chris Corner A collection of web design and development news and thoughts from CodePen's own Chris Coyier. Its January and were seeing a little round of CSS wishlists make the rounds. Tyler Sticka is mostly hoping for better support on stuff that already is starting to cook, like View Transitions, anchor positioning, balanced text, and scroll-driven animations. But hes got his own new wishes and has done the leg-work to properly propose them, like more useful vertical alignment (without extra work ). Christopher Kirk-Nielsen also has some wishes for better support for thing that ought to be doing that naturally, like Style Queries, but also has some really interesting ideas of his own like using transform to force an element of an unknown size into a specific size, which he also wrote up properly . Manuel Matuzovi has more love for Style (and State ) Queries (agreed there is some real potential here to reduce CSS size and complexity) and scope. On the doesnt-exist-yet side, a vote for mixins to which Ill echo: Yes, please! Elly Loel weighted in last year using the same distinctions: stuff that is already cooking (e.g. Custom Media) and stuff that doesnt exist yet (e.g. detecting flex-wrap ). Good news for Elly, some stuff from the list got done, like subgrid. Nathan Knowler joins the choir with strong votes for Style Queries, Scroll-Driven Animations, and scope, among others. Sarah Gebauer has a great one on her wishlist about borders and controlling the offset. Hey, SVG can do it and its super cool. Plus a shout out to a personal favorite: more useful attributes and the attr() function. Phew! Thats a lot of people taking the time to be pumped about CSS and make clear what they want. The way CSS is going lately I would not be surprised to see massive progress again in 2024. Stephanie Eckles points out 12 one-liners in CSS that are all tremendously useful and powerful. One liners. Stuff like p text-wrap: pretty; that just makes web type all the nicer. Five years ago our gaping mouths would have been on the floor if they knew what was coming. Brecht De Ruyte took two brand new CSS and HTML things and smashed them together: The new selectmenu element, which is exactly like select except fully CSS styleable. The Anchor Position API Its a cool interaction. But this was actually published mid-last-year, and the demo is already broken even. It only ever worked in Chrome Canary with the Experimental Web Platform Features flag turned on, so that just goes to show you how fast this experimental stuff moves. Its not selectmenu any more, its selectlist , but even after forking the demo and trying to fix it, I couldnt get it. I suspect its changes to the Anchor Positioning API that Im not up to snuff on. I do suspect this interaction is possible today, but youd either be using cutting edge APIs that may or may not be polyfillable, and/or recreating a ton of interaction and accessibility stuff that youd get for free with Brechts implementation. Ben Frain has a very clever idea for drawing angled lines in CSS (like a line chart). Which, weirdly, isnt a particularly easy thing to do in CSS. You can make lines various ways and rotate them and stuff, but its harder to be like: draw a line from here to here. SVG is typically the path for that. In Bens technique, you take advantage of the polygon() function and clip-path . You draw points in the clip path at certain coordinates, then go back over the exact same coordinates with a 1px difference, leaving that little gap where a new color can shine through. Like: clip-path: polygon( 0% 60%, 20% 90%, 40% 43.33%, 60% 61.67%, 80% 23.33%, 100% 18.33%, 100% calc(18.33% - 1px), 80% calc(23.33% - 1px), 60% calc(61.67% - 1px), 40% calc(43.33% - 1px), 20% calc(90% - 1px), 0% calc(60% - 1px)"

From Adam Argyle. pen Bouncy Image Radio Group Click the images in this gallery to see them bounce gently, then settle in naturally thanks to some slick CSS work with :has() and eased transitions from Temani Afif. Chris Corner A collection of web design and development news and thoughts from CodePen's own Chris Coyier. The switch is a pretty common design pattern on the web. Its pretty much a checkbox. In fact, under the HTML hood, it really ought to be an input type""checkbox"" or perhaps a select with just two option s (or a third if there is an indeterminate state). But unfortunately, the web doesnt give us any primitive that looks particularly switch-like, as in, some kind of knob that is flipped one way or the other. So we use CSS. For example, we hide the checkbox one way or another, making sure there is still a discoverable clickable area, then with the :checked selector, style something that looks switch-like. Heres a very classic example . Marcus Burnette nicely re-creating the iOS toggle look Im sure you could imagine using that for, say, toggling email notification settings on an off for some sort of app. We use them here on CodePen quite a bit, for stuff like toggling the privacy of a Pen. Or you might use a toggle to switch a site between dark mode and light mode. Speaking of that, Aleksandr Hovhannisyan has a solid article about the struggles of a dark mode toggle. Youd think it would be pretty straightforward, but it really isnt. Consider that users have system-level preferences in addition to your site-level preference, and you have to honor them in the proper order. Plus you have to set the controls properly as well as actually style the site accordingly, ideally without temporarily flashing the wrong colors. ( FART ). Aleksandr does a good job of it and links to other posts that have done a similarly good job. Its always way more code than you want it to be, leading me to think browsers and standards could and should get more involved, but I also admit I dont have a perfect idea on what they should do. Chrome has played with Auto Dark Mode , but its not clear how that trial went. (And speaking of Dark Mode, this gallery is pretty nicely done.) Anyway, I was trying to talk about switches! I saw Jen Simmons note that Safari is playing with a native switch. Heres the HTML: input type""checkbox"" switch / Nice. And heres what it looks like by default: No big surprise there! Its the native iOS toggle come to life. It respects accent-color in CSS like other form controls, which is great. But better, it has really sensible pseudo elements you can grab and style. You get ::thumb and ::track elements (nice clear naming) plus ::before and ::after work on the element itself, so there are a lot of possibilities. .custom-switch .custom-switch::thumb .custom-switch::track .custom-switch:checked::thumb .custom-switch:checked::track .custom-switch::checked::after .custom-switch::checked::before"

More, if somehow, say via a fetch request or the like, more videos get injected onto the page, there is no need to re-call any JavaScript to make these work. The way connectedCallback works theyll just do their thing automatically when they arrive in the DOM. Ill say Im a fan of the Light DOM Only approach to Web Components . But there are some relatively big things you give up when you dont use the Shadow DOM. Namely: slots. Slots is a pretty sweet mechanism for taking the guts HTML of a Web Component and slotting it properly into a likely-more-complicated bit of template HTML. This means that your fallback HTML can be simpler and possibly more appropriate. Cory LaViska explains it well , heres some usage : my-button Click me img slot""icon"" src""..."" alt""..."" / /my-button Which gets smushed with: template shadow-root button type""button"" span class""icon"" slot name""icon""/slot /span span class""label"" slot/slot /span /button /template You can imagine how the img there makes it into the slot with a matching name. And then rest of the content goes into the default slot. Corys article is actually about extending this concept and building out HTML with as many slots as you need, as powered by attributes. Its clever go read it . Speaking of parameters, thats an approach that some web components take. Rather than any guts HTML at all, you say what you want of the component via attributes on the element. Thats a rather JavaScript-framework-y way of doing things. An example of this is lite-youtube which you use entirely with attributes: lite-youtube videoid""ogfYd705cRs"" playlabel""Play: Keynote (Google I/O '18)"""

"CSS Coincidences, GSAP Lunch, and Abstract Animation","View this issue on CodePen CSS Coincidences, GSAP Lunch, and Abstract Animation This week's CodePen community highlights include a comiCSS coincidence from Alvaro Montoro, a delicious lunchtime with GSAP's ScrollTrigger from Tom Miller, and a beautiful abstract animation of a nighttime drive from wheatup. Plus, Nicolas Jesenberger brings the holiday cheer with a jaunty Santa hat, and Sebastian Schepis takes us into the mysterious world of Tripoles. pen Drive Home (CSS) wheatup evokes the feeling of a moody night time drive with a minimal bokeh dot animation in CSS. Inspired by a GLSL shader from The Art of Code. pen Santa Hat Button It's that time of year! Nicolas Jesenberger brings some Christmas cheer to a button with a little snow shower and a jaunty Santa hat. collection CodePenChallenge: Gradient Glow We wrapped up the November ""Style Trends"" challenge with a gradient glow! Check out our collection from week 4, including Pens by Mona Plamondon , Ryan Jagdfeld , Mads Stoumann , and Ismail Vittal . pen Grid Loader (React) Multi-colored dots slide in and out of view with a satisfying, subtle squish in this lovely loader from animation master Chris Gannon. pen Tripoles ""Tripoles are digital constructs made of energy and entropy. The Tripoles seen here are constructs made of component objects with the same name - tripoles have the same capabilities all active observers possess - the ability to sense energy, and the ability to mediate it into an action. Turns out all that is needed for enless complexity to arise are the simplest of actions - observation, mediation, actuation. Observers aren't just an emergent afterthought - observation is a fundamental creative force in the Universe."" From Sebastian Schepis. pen 25 Seconds of Confetti The Brutal Tooth expands on a tsParticles.js demo from Matteo Bruni to bring us 25 solid seconds of continuous confetti in this playful Pen. pen Mbius Strip - CSS Josetxu demonstrates some serious clip-path and gradient chops in this CSS rendition of an infinite mathematical object, the Mbius strip . sponsor Embeddable Data Importer for Businesses Flatfile makes importing clean & validated customer data fast & easy.

Game on, your way! pen Just about time for lunch... Tom Miller adds some ""GSAP ScrollTrigger magic to this handsome photo by Pablo Merchan "" in this luscious luncheon of a Pen. pen comiCSS: Coincidence? Alvaro Montoro recreates the JavaScript ""correlation vs. causation"" meme with CSS in this thought provoking Pen Chris Corner A collection of web design and development news and thoughts from CodePen's own Chris Coyier. Josh Comeau has a new learning guide out for CSS grid: An Interactive Guide to CSS Grid . I like how Josh gets into the mental model right away, because thats the biggest thing with big APIs like this: you need to get the basics of how it works in your head so you know when and why to reach for it. The niche details are less important. You can look them up. Mostly you need to understand that the thing exists and what it is capable of. Ideally you can write a basic setup from memory. Then the more niche stuff you reference. Joshs guide, especially with the interactivity, loads you up with that mental model. Josh has done the same before with an An Interactive Guide to Flexbox . The interactive bit goes a long way in locking in that mental model. In my CSS-Tricks days, our guide to flexbox was also decent at explaining the model I think, and also was a decent reference guide at the same time. But it didnt have that interactivity so people were left to extracting the information to their own code to play. Once people are writing their own layout code, Id wager thats also a pretty big moment for locking in a mental model. CodePen editable embeds might be a good way to bring that to guides like this. I know that a very lot of people had their ah-ha moment with flexbox via Flexbox Froggy , and I think its that combination of interactivity and real code that made that so effective. Speaking of Cool Josh Ideas, have you seen his operator lookup page ? JavaScript has a pretty decent number of operators, and some of them you really have to look up to remember sometimes: Sometimes my brain goes whats the one where you set the value, but if the value is null, provide a fallback . Which is this one . Do you know about import maps yet? They arent some new niche thing, they are supported across the board . (Well, a little new, maybe). I like Yoshi Huangs article(s) on them, they do a good job of setting the stage. My brain goes a little like this. This is really common code to see, but its actually invalid JavaScript: import lodash from ""lodash""; If you see code like that, traditionally , it means that the JavaScript will be going through a processor of some sort that is going to resolve ""lodash"" to some actual location where that code can be found. If we wanted that code to be valid JavaScript, wed either have to: Import from a relative file path (e.g. that string has got to start with a dot or a slash) Import from a URL The latter being like: import lodash from ' But now, the original import statement actually is valid. That is, as long as we use an import map. From Yoshis article, something like: script type""importmap"" ""imports"": ""lodash"": ""/nodemodules/lodash-es/lodash.js"""

Chris Corner A collection of web design and development news and thoughts from CodePen's own Chris Coyier. Im a sucker for a new coding font. I generally dont think what coding font you use affects productivity in any significant way (unless its distracting) so farting around and switching it up is just a fun little thing to do. Like pushing around the furniture in your room or taking a different bike route to work. So count me in for playing with GitHubs new set of monospace coding fonts: Monaspace . (Before I get too far without mentioning it, you can use them on CodePen just by visiting your editor settings and picking one.) The fact that there is five different stylized versions alone is pretty note worthy, but there are a variety of other features that are pretty darn cool. Texture Healing feels like a made up term, but what it does is pretty easy to understand and clearly useful. It basically makes it so wide letters dont have to scrunch themselves and narrow letters dont have to exaggerate themselves. They say: Texture healing works by finding each pair of adjacent characters where one wants more space, and one has too much. Narrow characters are swapped for ones that cede some of their whitespace, and wider characters are swapped for ones that extend to the very edge of their box. Which is done with the OpenType feature contextual alternates. Its a little bit like a ligature, where certain character combinations flop out into a new glyph that works best with them together, only, ya know, slightly different. Monaspace has ligatures too. Ligatures are pretty controversial in coding fonts. For instance some people really hate that ! might turn into as a ligature as that is like a deviation from the literal syntax of the language you may be writing. They arent my favorite but its not a firmly held opinion and its easy enough just to not use them. (They arent enabled on CodePen, as it seems like it might be confusing for some beginners.) They come as a variable font, which I love because variable fonts rule. And its not a phoned in variable font with one measly axis, its weight, and width, and slant, which is wonderful. The download comes both with variable and non-variable versions. If you dont plan to use the variable-ness, the variable fonts are an order of magnitude larger so probably use the non-variable versions. If its not on the web it probably doesnt matter. Also curious they only shipped .woff and not .woff2 ? My very favorite idea they have around this superfamily is the idea of mixing and matching them for different reasons in the same UI. The idea of having an italic monospace is starting to be more and more common. Gotta shout out the OG Operator for breaking that ground. Setting comments in italics is still just a super cool idea to me. Now we could use Radon for that, a different typeface entirely designed for it. In the image above, they suggest JSDoc-style comments using Xenon and GitHub CoPilot using Krypton. I love it. Ship it. (But I dont think its possible in VS Code yet, but considering Microsoft makes both, youd think its coming.) To make that possible, essentially, you need syntax highlighting tools to provide tokens/classes that make it easy to identify different aspects of code. Its certainly possible, and probably not even that hard, but its probably a somewhat tricky thing to roll out with so many third-party themes out there. But anyway, how great is this? If youre into playing with different coding fonts, well make sure to explore the fact that we have over 20 of them on CodePen to switch between. But of course there are far more than that out in the wild. A great read about the landscape of playful and fun coding fonts is Doug Wilsons Coding with Character . Doug dug (ha) up this great example of IBM SELECTRIC TYPE SAMPLES (literally different typewriter fonts you could swap between by replacing a metal ball in the typewriter): So cool! I love that this new wave of coding fonts is kind of a callback to what was happening here, whether everyone recognizes it or not. The first one Doug mentions is Operator which I used for years and years after it came out and still love. The second is Comic Code: My first thought: This has to be a joke, right?! Comic Sans has a bad reputation and was never meant to be used for codingbut what if? That is what crazy mastermind Toshi Omagari seemed to ask. He says, Comic Code is a monospaced adaptation of the most over-hated typeface. I havent asked, but I feel his thought process may have been something like this GIF . Believe it or not, I think it actually works and certainly brings a smileor at least a smirkto your face Totally agree! It works! While I was in our code base putting in the Monaspace fonts, of course I couldnt resist doing general code cleanup. The Monaspace fonts only ship in .woff, so the font-face in CSS is pretty much as simple as: font-face font-family: 'Font Name'; src: url('./fonts/font.woff') format('woff'); You can get away with only shipping in woff2 these days, so some of our fonts that have that format, thats exactly what Im doing. The simplicity there just feels great since this used to be such a complex bit of code in the past with loads of formats. Then I recently learned from an Ollie Williams blog post that you dont have to put the format as a string anymore, keywords work, so: font-face font-family: 'Font Name'; src: url('./fonts/font.woff2') format(woff2);"

Xbox Parental Controls and Family Settings,"FTC Xbox is improving our data collection processes around accounts for children. View as Webpage Microsofts Xbox Parental Controls and Family Settings Xbox is improving our data collection processes around accounts for children. On 05 June 2023, we entered into a settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to resolve allegations that our previous account creation process for Xbox Live improperly collected information from children without properly notifying and getting permission from their parents. As part of the settlement, were writing to let you know about privacy settings to protect children playing on your Xbox. Create a child account If there is a child that plays on your adult Xbox account, please create a child account for them. GET STARTED Regularly check privacy settings A child Xbox account has privacy settings that protect children. For example, a child Xbox account by default only lets children communicate with friends that you approve; and limits how Microsoft shares the childs personal information with others. Xbox family safety settings give you more privacy options to choose from. To review your settings, go to your Privacy Dashboard, then click on the Xbox icon to get to your Privacy and online safety settings. Now, and in the future, you can see the personal information we collect from children linked to your account. Sign in to your account on your Privacy Dashboard and select your child's account in the drop-down to review and clear data. Additionally, you can ask us to delete the account by submitting a request through our account closure form. Please be sure to sign in with your childs account credentials. To manage consent for a child, go to your Microsoft family safety dashboard. Sign in to your account, click the three dots next to your childs name, then manage consent. Committed to protecting children To learn about what data we collect and how we use it, read the Microsoft Privacy Statement. The Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act gives you control over the information companies collect from your children under 13. To learn more, read the Federal Trade Commissions Protecting Your Childs Privacy Online and Xboxs online safety and privacy settings.

Chris Corner A collection of web design and development news and thoughts from CodePen's own Chris Coyier. If you ever need some inspiration for buttons, definitely check out Lucas Bonomis buttons.cool . This is a better-than-it-needs-to-be one-off site just for beautiful buttons: But its not just a design gallery, its made for front-end developers in that you can see the code, see them being live-rendered right on the page, and of course, the best part is you can pop right over to CodePen for a look. Looks like its taking submissions . How hard is a Dark Mode to pull off? Or perhaps more accurately, how hard is it to pull off a second color mode? Some of us have dark-mode-first websites, ya know . I thought Wes Bos phrased the question well : Question for those who have implemented light/dark mode: how much is just swapping out variables, and how much is custom code, and tending to edge cases? I answered: fiddy fiddy. In the new version of CodePen were working on, we will have a site-wide theme setting (which is separated from what syntax highlighting theme you choose). CodePen being a pretty complex site, it involved quite a bit of CSS custom property setting. So in a sense, it was mostly just swapping out variables, but quite a few of those variables exist just because of different color modes, most of which I might even call an edge case. For us: north of 100 south of 200. I found this to be challenging but ultimately a fair approach. Sometimes you see ideas going around of how simple it could be. For instance, hes Akhil Arjun saying it can be done in one line : htmltheme'dark-mode' filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg); And heres Mads Stoumann with a totally different 3-line approach: body background-color: Canvas; color: CanvasText; color-scheme: light dark; While I appreciate a good CSS trick and these are good things to know about, Im going to go ahead and say these super minimal approaches probably arent going to get you very far. Youre going to want better control than this and youre going to need to deal with those edge cases. Now that we have such powerful layout tools in CSS (keep em coming, CSS!) its fun to see little layout situations that look fairly simple but are still a little challenging. Tyler Sticka ran across one he calls Tricky Floating Image Alignment . The idea is to have some text that is center aligned with an image, but if the text grows larger than the image, use the behavior of float . I liked the solution in the end. Its a throwback to the way we used to be able to vertically center stuff with top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%) . This will do the centering nicely, but when the text is bigger than the container, they essentially cancel out and so essentially do nothing. Heres another tricky layout situation, this time involving newfangled HTML and CSS features, namely anchor positioning. (Think of it as positioning an element based on another arbitrary elements position.) Eric Meyer blogged it as Nuclear Anchored Sidenotes . Imagine a footnote, except on a large enough screen, its more like a sidenote. That is, the note goes into empty sidebar space at the exact line that the footnote marker appears on. But to really pull this off, youre using anchor positions of multiple elements: Yes, Im anchoring the sidenotes with respect to two completely different anchors, one of which is a descendant of the other. Thats okay! You can do that! I did not know you could do that, but I like it. top: anchor(top); / implicit anchor /"

This 3D layered Pen is the 7th in a monthlong series. Follow Jon to keep time in your following feed. Chris Corner A collection of web design and development news and thoughts from CodePen's own Chris Coyier. Youve seen CSS new :has() selector right? There are all these basic use cases that leave me smiling because the solutions of the past were inelegant at best, and now are easy and satisfying. Heres one: You want margin below your h2 unless there is a time right below it, then no margin but put the margin below the time instead. One approach to this with :has() is just a few lines and reads very clearly to me: h2 margin-block-end: 1.2rem; &:has( time) margin-block-end: 0; &:has( time) time margin-block-end: 1.2rem; Demo But as I mentioned, thats a basic use case. The power of :has() is very deep, as it allows for inspection from any DOM element down the tree, then moving as far back up as needed. Its a bit hard to wrap my mind around that sometimes. Like Jim Neilsen said : I feel like lots of people have their own little oh yeah! moments with this CSS feature. Michelle Barker blogged a few of them , including an interesting combination with the :target selector. Does a certain have an element that is targetted? Yes? Animate the grid to reveal an otherwise hidden area: Poking around my own code bases, I can see it starting to sprinkle in. Its interesting to see when it comes to unknown data coming into templates. Heres a JSX example: div class""things"" things.map(thing return( div class""thing"" keything.id th data-categorything.categorything.name/h3 thing.text /div ); ) /div Here Ive spat out a totally arbitrary list of things. I found it most useful to have the data-category attribute on the header, as direct styling with that was useful. But what if the parent needs styling based on that? Easy: .thing:has(data-category""widget"") background: yellow; More, what if the entire group needs a special style? And if it does, make all the headers smaller? .things:has(data-category""widget"") h3 font-size: 80%; Go down, then back up! Im even very-mindblown-y on the idea that quantity queries are now easy. Does this list have at least 11 items in it? Yes? Then do something: ol:has(li:nth-child(11)) color: red;"

See also, Jhey Tompkins' variation on the same concept . Chris Corner A collection of web design and development news and thoughts from CodePen's own Chris Coyier. Chrome 117 went stable this past week. There is a website where you can see what the plan is for Chrome releases, by the way, which is handy when you care about such things. Chrome releases a major version about once a month, and I usually dont feel ultra compelled to write anything about it specifically. Rachel Andrew does a great job covering web platform updates each month on Web.dev, like this past New to the web platform in August . Im extra excited about this one, though, because it means subgrid has now shipped across all three major browsers. Chrome was the straggler here: Firefox shipped subgrid on Dec 2, 2019. Safari shipped subgrid on Sep 11, 2022. Chrome shipped subgrid on Sep 12, 2023. Caniuse is a great site for not only checking support but also seeing when versions shipped that have support. Lest I type too many words without explaining what subgrid is its a keyword that works with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows that allow you to suck in the grid lines that pass through the element from the parent grid. .parent display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr; .child grid-column: 2 / 4; display: grid; grid-template-columns: subgrid; Does your browser support it? Probably, but its still good to check and to code around that check. Bramus has a Pen thats a quicky check. The CSS feature supports is up for the job: output::after content: "" Your browser does not support subgrid""; supports(grid-template-rows: subgrid) output::after content: "" Your browser supports subgrid"";"

"View Transitions, Stylish Shadows, and a Pixelated Waterfall","View this issue on CodePen View Transitions, Stylish Shadows, and a Pixelated Waterfall This week's CodePen community highlights includes a big dose of the view transitions API: a bookmark app UI from Aysenur Turk, and a tremendous guide to the in-and-outs of the API from Mojtaba Seyedi. Plus, Temani Afif and Adam Argyle share stylish image shadows, and Kit Jenson sends a barrel down a pixelated waterfall (that has a secret!) pen Merging Letter Toggle ""A toggle switch combined with FF or N to spell OFF or ON, and the letters merge or split depending on the state."" From Jon Kantner. pen Bookmark App - View Transitions Aysenur Turk translates a Dribbble shot by Dwinawan to SCSS & JS, and demonstrates the panache of the view transitions API in this irresistibly clickable Pen. pen (Svelte) Range Slider Simon Goellner adds ""fancy, bouncy, floating labels"" that wave as you drag the pips along the range slider in this interactive Pen, inspired by a Dribble shot by Antonin Kus . pen GSAP Mask Mouse Effect alig01 reveals a hidden truth of the internet with a slick spotlight effect in this GSAP-powered Pen. link What is the View Transitions API? Mojtaba Seyedi wrote a comprehensive guide to the power of the View Transitions API, complete with lots of linked & embedded Pens so you can jump right in and try it yourself. pen Infinite Image Shadow In Temani Afif's Pen, photos cast colorful shadows that stretch onnnnnnnn and on forever in both square and rounded corner varieties. collection CodePenChallenge: Pagination September's challenge is all about navigation, and we started with pagination.

It's one of the most common questions developers have when starting with MongoDB Atlas. And the answer is, it depends. In this article, learn the basics of data modeling you can use when designing the database schema for your application. pen Waterfall & Barrel ""A pixel-based waterfall. No reason... thought it would be a fun challenge. Of course I couldn't leave it alone, so now there is a hidden cave and floating barrel. Why, you ask? I don't know honestly."" From Kit Jenson. pen highlight compliment to a text-shadow effect ""That 2px (almost) white highlight on the top of the text makes it seem as though there's a light source."" From Adam Argyle. Chris Corner A collection of web design and development news and thoughts from CodePen's own Chris Coyier. I think the nail is in coffin now : you should never design something for the web with only one (or even a narrow set) of particular viewport sizes in mind. Its just so darn tempting to think that way. You have a couple of pretty specific screen sizes in front of you right now, you likely design toward those to some degree. Design tools often ask you to draw a rectangle that represent a screen to design for. Testing tools sometimes show you a site at a set of pre-set screen sizes. It can feel normal and fine to design toward, say, three sizes, and hone in on them. Honestly, that might end up working fine, but it might not! It might lead to some awkward in-betweens, especially if you are very rigid in writing CSS that only changes at those specific breakpoints only. Thats the thing, really. You just dont have to think in really specific breakpoints anymore. Media query width breakpoints are still a fine tool, but now weve got viewport units, container units, container queries, calc/min/max/clamp, and all sorts of other stuff that allow you to design components and pages that work well and look good at the size and under the conditions they are in. Its just a better way to code. But this stuff has only relatively recently arrived in CSS so itll take a minute for it all to settle in. This isnt even really new news. Over a decade ago , I was like, yo, there are a ton of different sizes that your site is getting viewed at. Deal with it. Now we can properly. And now for something completely different Have websites gone to crap? Browse around popular sites, and I think youll land on an easy yes. Especially on mobile, cripes. Just to name a few: they are too slow to load, the ads and popups are too obtrusive, and there is too much usage of fixed-position elements that reduce usable area. This website User Inyerface satirized it recently, and its pretty funny (ya know, if being intentionally frustrated is your thing, gamers should relate). People have been worried about this for ages, and it never seems to get any better. Brad Frost called it BS . A couple folks made termsandconditions.game mining these patterns for ideas. Guangyi Lis how-i-experience-web-today.com gets at the heart of the complete experience. Tracking is a big part of this story, and clickclickclick.click pokes at that. This all just makes me sad. Fortunately, most things are fine . And now for something completely different Have you seen the popover API ? Its a neat idea, already play-with-able in Chrome. Think styled tooltips. The idea is that you connect some interaction (click of a button) to toggling another element with more information or context. Amazingly, to me, this HTML totally works in Chrome with no CSS or JavaScript at all: button popovertarget""my-popover""Open Popover/button div id""my-popover"" popover pI am a popover with more information./p"

"Stretchy Type, CSS Timers, and Poisson Disk Sampling","a full screen video as a background at any screen size, with a combo of ""absolute positioning, full viewport width and height, and 'object-fit: cover;'"" Chris Corner A collection of web design and development news and thoughts from CodePen's own Chris Coyier. SVG has so many tricks up its sleeve. Its really a full-featured drawing API literally designed for the web, but few of us really truly understand it nor reach for it enough. Heck, I even wrote a book about it , and I dont. At the time, just getting people to use SVG for icons felt like an uphill battle, but thankfully, I think that one has been won. Lets look at some cool SVG examples that have crossed my desk lately. Animate an SVG Shapes Inner Stroke Christopher Kirk-Nielsen with a variety of demos that are a good reminder that stroke is animatable (like the width of it), which can do some cool effects. This demo looks like the classic one where the stroke moves to the inside only, filling the shapes. It was only in the last few years that browsers like Chrome GPU accelerated SVG animations , making stuff like this really smooth. SVG viewBox padding To be clear, the viewBox in SVG does not actually have padding. But its an important thing to think about. Chuan makes the point that if you make a 1010 area via the viewBox , then make a rect that fills that 1010 area, the stroke around it, the stroke will be half cut off. Thats because stroke straddles the edge of shapes in SVG. So you either gotta monkey with the coordinates of the shapes, or you gotta adjust the viewBox to handle it. Chuans thinking is: let a processor handle it. viewBox""0 0 10 10 padding .5"" / translates to / viewBox""-.5 -.5 11 11"" Clever thinking, really. The CSS Doodle tool can do it . So you can set an SVG circles radius in CSS? The very basic answer to Paul Heberts questions is: yeah, totally. Like if you have this: svg viewBox""0 0 100 100"" xmlns"" circle cx""50"" cy""50"" r""50"" / /svg You can adjust the radius in CSS like: circle r: 20; Not CSS you see every day, but yeah, thats totally fine. But Pauls point is that normally you set the radius in the SVG code, but you might need it in CSS code. Like, a way to keep them in sync is good. In Pauls demo , it looks like he doesnt even set the radius in SVG at all, just does it in CSS via a --radius Custom Property, then uses that in the other calculations needed to make these percentage meters work. Understanding SVG Paths The path element in SVG is the most complicated of the shape drawing elements. In fact, as I understand it, all the other elements are just syntactic sugar over a path anyway. I once wrote An Illustrated Guide when I was learning it and figuring it out. But Nanda Syahrasyad has outdone me easily in Understanding SVG Paths . The trick is understanding the commands. They are pretty understandable in the end, as it were. They are like pick the pen up and move it here, then draw a line over to here or starting where you are, move the pen in this direction this far or draw a curve from here to there using these other two points as essentially gravitational poles. If you get into it, youll find yourselves (gasp) drawing your own shapes. I love Nandas opener: I think youre kind of a next-level front-end developer if youre building bending ass buttons like that. SVGs have additional pointer-events properties If youre like me, you think of pointer-events in CSS as a thing you use to set none once in a while. Maybe you set some colored overlay div over something, but you dont want it to actually eat up clicks, so you set pointer-events: none on it and those clicks will slide right through. When it comes to SVG, though, Stefan Judis has noted some additional values for it that are specific to SVG like: .foo pointer-events: visiblePainted;"

"Posters, Pointers, and Pulling to Refresh","View this issue on CodePen Posters, Pointers, and Pulling to Refresh What a great week of interesting work, thanks to you lovely folks in the CodePen community. There is some work inspired by print design, which always makes for interesting results, especially when there are interactive adaptations. New CSS is bustin' still, allowing for interactions that would have been hard or impossible before (see the pull to refresh stuff). Hyperplexed has a new one with his trademark ""let's break this complex effect down into smaller problems"" approach. And you know what, I think we'll all learn a little something about how coffee drinks are made this week. pen Interactive Art Poster Homage to Gernes Each of the circles is an input of typecolor, so you can click or tap them to open a color picker and change them. Open the full Pen to see a dark mode toggle as well. pen Magic Wand Reveal The latest Hyperplexed video is of this interactive wave-across effect that reveals images by moving them from not there at all to adjusting the opacity and blur to bring them in. There is loads of little details to get right though! pen OJaOQwz Dillon says: ""Another pen using Bridson's algorithm and Delaunay triangulation. / styles when :has() is supported / It is useful to think about what your plan is for detection, though. Like does it matter if Firefox doesnt support :has() for what you are trying to do? Are you prepared to do it some other way if its not? As an example, I was talking to Eric Meyer the other day, and somehow table row/column highlighting came up, and he made a demo with :has() . Now youd have to decide: how important is that effect? As written, in Firefox, just the cell you hover over highlights, so you could decide thats fine, and then you dont need any feature detection at all; you just let it fail. Alternatively, you could decide to use a supports query in CSS and highlight the entire row if :has() isnt supported, which is a similar effect (if not quite as cool). Another decision you could make is to do the test in JavaScript and use a JavaScript-powered fallback if necessary. Good news, Stephanie has a JavaScript testing tool just for this. It uses a number of different techniques to report if a feature is supported or not. Ultimately you could use it for our :has() test like: script type""module"" import as SupportsCSS from "" const tests ""has""; SupportsCSS.init( tests ); if (!SupportsCSSTests.results.has) document.head.insertAdjacentHTML( ""beforeend"", ""styletr:hover background: rgba(255,0,0,0.33); /style"" ); /script Ya know, just while were talking about feature detection in CSS, a typography-specific feature tester crossed my desk the other day, font-tech and font-format : supports font-tech(palettes) .palette display: block; supports font-format(woff2) div display: block; Just interesting to me; Ive never seen those specific functions before. Wait, wait, I gotta do one more about feature detection. There are some things that you cannot detect in CSS, and is kind of a pain in the butt to detect in JavaScript also. Ahmad Shadeed made this point in Do we need CSS flex-wrap detection? The point has been made again and again that we need certain state detections like a :stuck selector for position: sticky; elements, and it sounds likely well get that . But is wrapped or not is another form of state, Id say. Ahmads use case was like if a line in a flexbox layout wraps, its saying: there isnt room for these on one line. But where that is is totally arbitrary based on content and element size. But if we knew exactly when that break was, we could, for example, use that exact moment to break a line of navigation into a hamburger rather than guessing at some magic number size. Strong point, I think. I have an unnatural affinity for the yellow fade technique. Its this idea that works with the :target selector in CSS and on-page anchor links. Imagine a table of contents where you click a link, and it jumps the page down (or scrolls, I suppose if you use scroll-behavior: smooth ). How do you know exactly where the page is trying to take you to and draw your attention toward? The element is probably at the top of the page, but it might not be if the page is too short. The yellow fade technique just makes it way more clear. When that jump happens, that element becomes the : target , and you apply a background-color animation to it (light yellow!) that draws attention to it. Its just nice, I think. There are some classic examples on CodePen, naturally. The idea can also be applied to an element being added to the DOM, drawing attention to the fact that it just appeared. Thats what Bramus Van Damme does in The Yellow Fade Technique with Modern CSS using starting-style . Erm starting-style , whats that? Its basically built for the yellow fade technique. . div transition: background-color 0.5s; background-color: transparent; starting-style background-color: yellow; --bg: hsl(var(--hue) 50% 50%); h1 --text: color-contrast(var(--bg) vs black, white); color: var(--text); background: hsl(0 0% 0% / 40%); supports (background: hsl(from red h s l)) h1 background: oklch(from color-contrast(var(--text) vs black,white) l c h / 40%);"

"CodePen Spark Video Blend Modes, Retro Buttons, and Long Shadows","& div ... Ends up as: :is(main, intro) div ... Which makes it go from 0,0,1 for main div to 1,0,1 making it vastly more specific. Im not sure if nesting gotchas is the ultimate example of CSS complexity gone wild, but its just one little potential poke. I remember in the Sass heyday that people would point to extend as a complexity code smell and they werent wrong. Perhaps thanks to the scale and pervasiveness of npm, piles of questionable third-party code is another cause of complexity concern on the front-end. Michelle Barker gets into this in Reducing Complexity in Front End Development where shes ruminating on Jack Franklins recent talk at All Day Hey. A quick look in our Node modules folder quickly exposes the web of complexity within, which few of us can really fathom. A single point of failure can bring down the entire stack, like the well-worn house of cards metaphor. Reducing dependencies, Ill go out on a limb and say, is nearly always worth it in the sense of saving future-you headaches. Or as grug says: one day code base understandable and grug can get work done, everything good! next day impossible: complexity demon spirit has entered code and very dangerous situation!

Hover over an image to view it in full color. Chris Corner A collection of web design and development news and thoughts from CodePen's own Chris Coyier. If I were going to argue against scope , the new CSS feature, I might say that CSS already has scope. Like, every selector is scope. If you say .el, youre saying scope this bit of CSS to elements that have the class name of el'. But then someone might tell you, ok, but what about donut scope ? Donut scope is a way for a scope to stop. Keith Grant shows that off in a recent article : scope (.card) to (.slot) / Scoped styles target only inside .card but not inside .slot / :scope padding: 1rem; background-color: white; .title font-size: 1.2rem; font-family: Georgia, serif; Imagine that applied to this HTML: div class""card"" h3 class""title""Moon lander div class""slot"" !-- scoped styles wont target anything here! -- /div /div Im not sure how I feel about that, honestly. Dont hate it, but also cant think of a time when I really really wanted that. That might be because its never existed so my brain didnt try to reach for it. But container queries didnt exist before, either, and I think we all pined for those anyway. Still, its a bit of a 1 for scope because its a thing we cant do any other way. If I was still arguing against scope , then Id say, well, it turns out actually you can replicate donut scope, thanks to another modern CSS feature, :has(), as Bramus blogged : .from :has( .to) outline: 1px solid red; And actually, you dont even need that . So Im afraid I have to rescind the point I gave scope . Are there any other tricks up its sleeve? It does have one! Its called proximity . This is just kind of a bummer situation in CSS: div class""green"" pIm green/p div class""blue"" pIm blue/p /div /div If you wrote the CSS like this: .blue p color: blue; .green p color: green; Then both paragraphs are green . Just because the green selector came second. Thats just how CSS selectors work. Both have the same specificity so the latter one wins. We can fix this with scopes: scope (.green) p color: green; scope (.blue) p color: blue;"

For the Good & Not So Good Parts of Summer,Weve Got You Covered
The latest from the front-end and fullstack worlds,"Get up to speed with what's going on in front-end, Node.js and beyond! Hi Ambarish, Frontend Masters remains, as ever, a site focused on bringing experts together to teach you modern front-end (and increasingly back-end) development skills. We've never been a direct news source, so it is high time we gave you a heads-up on some stories, releases, and projects that deserve a look. Introducing the Frontend to Fullstack Monthly Newsletter ! We teamed up with our friends over at Frontend Focus ( ) and JavaScript Weekly ( ) to look over the past month in the front-end, JavaScript, and Node.js worlds and bring together the biggest stories that you'd find valuable. Enjoy! -- Marc Grabanski CEO & UI Developer Frontend Masters Frontend to Fullstack : Issue 1 News updates Node.js v20 (Current) Released ( ) April's biggest release in our space was almost certainly Node.js v20, the latest version of the popular server-side runtime. It takes some cues from Deno in the shape of a new experimental permissions model. This is a feature Deno has at its core but now you can restrict access to certain capabilities in Node too. Angular v16 Released ( ) With the biggest release since the initial rollout of Angular, v16 of the extensive framework introduces a preview of a new signals-based reactivity model, RxJS interop, improved SSR and hydration, experimental esbuild support, Jest unit testing, and more. An Update on the Web's Lock Icon ( ) The use of a padlock icon in Web browsers has long symbolized the use of a secured connection to load a page, but now that HTTPS / TLS are the norm, is it time for a change? Google says yes, and proposes a curious looking alternative. Other key releases recently include Vite 4.3 ( ) , TypeScript 5.1 Beta ( ) and Qwik 1.0. ( ) Handy tutorials Can You Create Beautiful Stroked Text in CSS? ( ) Explores several different approaches for creating stroked text (or outline text) in CSS and with SVGs. Dissecting npm Malware: Five Packages and Their 'Evil' Install Scripts ( ) npm related security continues to be a big topic and a common security vector is the install script thats run when you install a package. Optimizing Resource Loading with the Fetch Priority API ( ) Fetch Priority (previously known as Priority Hints) indicates the relative priority of resources to the browser it can enable optimal loading and improve Core Web Vitals. Its currently supported in Chrome and Edge. Passkeys: What and Why? ( ) The author has been studying up and experimenting with passkeys and the associated WebAuthn API that they are built on top of. This is a solid primer on an increasingly popular security option. FYI we also have a course on Web Auth that covers passkeys ( ) Exploring the Potential of Web Workers for Multithreading on the Web ( ) A look at the importance of Web Workers for multithreading in the browser, including the limitations and considerations of using them and the strategies for mitigating potential issues. Web Accessibility: A Reference to Creating Inclusive Websites ( ) This solid guide covers some of the key principles and best practices to follow in order to create an inclusive user-friendly online experience for everyone. CSS Text Balancing with text-wrap:balance ( ) An exploration of new CSS text balancing features, including where it might come in useful. Browser support is limited for now, but it's a handy progressive enhancement in any case. CSS Blend Modes ( ) A look at what CSS blend modes are and how to use them with the background-blend-mode and mix-blend-mode properties. Lots of code and great interactive examples. All major browsers support them. Useful projects Babylon.js 6.0: The Powerful Web-Based 3D Framework ( ) Babylon.js remains one of the worlds leading WebGL-based graphics engines with a visual scene builder and best-in-class physically-based rendering. v6.0 includes a new physics plugin, fluid rendering, major improvements to how reflections are handled, screen reader support, and more. Modern Alternatives to Create React App ( ) create-react-app has been the go to for building single-page React apps for years, but this article touches on some of the alternatives now in common use. Chart.js 4.3: Canvas-Based Charts for the Web ( ) A long standing library that feels like its been there forever but still looks fresh and gets solid updates. Bar, line, area, bubble, pie, donut, scatter, and radar charts are all straightforward to produce. Pico.css: A Minimal CSS Framework for Semantic HTML ( ) The focus is more on styling native HTML elements, rather than littering your HTML with classes. Includes dark and light mode themes out-of-the-box. And some random items It turns out that even Nintendo has built a game in JavaScript. A developer discovered ( ) that 2015's Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Tipping Stars for the Wii U and 3DS was written with HTML and JavaScript under the hood and managed to build a shim to get it running in a normal browser. Deno vs. Node: No One is Ready for the Move? ( ) Deno ( ) has a lot going for it as an alternative to Node, but Node has time, maturity and a huge, established userbase on its side (and continues to develop, as seen with Node v20).

Rust for TypeScript Developers with ThePrimeagen,"ThePrimeagen is back to teach us the ""most loved"" language, Rust! Hi Ambarish, Rust has been voted the ""most loved"" coding language on the Stack Overflow survey for seven years in a row! ( see discussion on Reddit ( ) ) Leerob from Vercel declared Rust the language for the future of JavaScript infrastructure ( ).

Who better to talk about the 'most loved' coding language than ThePrimeagen - who brings his signature energy, style and passion to his new Rust for TypeScript developers course ( ) ! ThePrimeagen teaching his new Rust for TypeScript devs course ( ) Rust for TypeScript Developers ( ) Rust offers memory safety without a garbage collector, impressive performance, and a strong type system similar to TypeScript, but with even more robustness. Youll use Vectors and Structs just like you use Arrays and Objects and use Options to handle null and undefined types. Youll work your way up to creating custom trait implementations, making your code more modular and testable. ThePrimeagen also guides you through the core memory management concepts, including the Borrow Checker. Oh, and he uses Vim, by the way. ThePrimeagen coding in Rust ( ) Here are some other key concepts covered in the course: Learn core constructs like Vectors, Tuples, and Structs Work with Iterators, Enums, and Options Understand the Borrow Checker and mutable/immutable references Explore the differences between Traits and Interfaces and the power of custom/generic Traits Grab a membership today ( ) and we hope you enjoy learning Rust ( ) ! -- Marc Grabanski CEO & UI Developer Frontend Masters Take Frontend Masters courses on your phone or tablet using our iOS ( ) and Android ( ) apps you can even download our courses to learn offline: ( ) ( ) Your friends: Frontend Masters, 60 South 6th St, Minneapolis MN 55402"

Connecting With Your Discord Friends Is About To Be Way Easier,"What you need to know about upcoming username changes Hey HypeSquad, While youre (hopefully!) planning your summer vacation to lounge by the pool or camp in the forest, weve got a big update to share with you. Lets dive into something coming soon thatll be important for all Discord users to be aware of changes to our Username system. Were making changes to our username system by removing discriminators and introducing new, unique usernames (username) and display names. This change will make sharing your username with friends easier and give you more control over your identity on Discord! Since 2015, every Discord username has been cAsE sEnSitIvE and had a number attached to it called a discriminator (e.g., 0001). This lets you have the same username as someone else as long as you have different discriminators or different case letters. However, this also means you have to remember a set of 4-digit numbers and account for case sensitivity to connect with your friends. We wanted to make it easier for you to add your friends while preserving your ability to use your preferred name across Discord. New usernames are lowercase, alphanumeric, limited to certain special characters, and do not have discriminators, making them easier to remember, read, type, and share. Now, rather than having to remember PhiBi8936, you just say Im phibiscool and thats it. Your new username will be unique to you, and when friends try to add you there wont be any mistakes of the wrong discriminator or incorrect letter casing. Display names are whats shown to both your friends and communities. Think of them as server nicknames that work globally across Discord. You can change it whenever you want, and it can be whatever you want, including special characters, as long as it follows our community guidelines If a username you were eyeing gets taken before you can claim it, no worries you can still use it as a display name. We know these are some big changes, but wanted to give you early notice since these will affect how you interact on Discord in the future. Once this change rolls out for you, well send a pop-up in-app for you to pick a new username. The older your Discord account, the sooner you will become eligible to pick a new username. Until next time, Discord Community Team Discord Team 444 De Haro Street, Suite 200, San Francisco, CA 94107"

Chris Corner A collection of web design and development news and thoughts from CodePen's own Chris Coyier. If youre a super normal person like me, youve gone to war with typographic widows and orphans many times over your years as a developer, trying to ensure they dont happen and ruin anyones day. You know what I mean, a headline with one silly little word that has wrapped down onto its own line. If only you could add a couple of soft returns in there to prevent it. You can, of course, but you know better. A soft return might fix a problem at one particular container width, that break causes an even more awkward problem at another container width. One technique that is sometimes employed is to insert an &nbsp; (non-breaking space) between the last two words (maybe even three?) of a headline (or paragraphs, if youre nasty). This little piggy went to&nbsp;market None of us can be troubled to hand-code that if were in charge of the HTML of headlines regularly. I wrote my own PHP to split headlines by word and manually insert the non-breaking space on CSS-Tricks a decade or more ago. It can be done in client-side JavaScript too, naturally, but nobody wants to see that reflow. Finally, along comes the web platform with something that looks like a solution: h1, h2, h3 text-wrap: balance;"
