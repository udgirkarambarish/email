Congratulations on being one of TIME100's Most InfluentialPeople in AI See post: Hotel chains across the country are ramping up recruitment, with new room additions slated to reach more than 14,000 this year, Aneesh Phadnis reports for businessline. Indian Hotels Company Limited, which runs the Taj Group of Hotels, is planning to open 20 properties in FY24 and hire 2,500 direct employees. It has also started a leadership accelerator programme for professionals with MBA degrees, the report says. The Accor Group, which operates brands like Novotel and ibis, is looking to hire 800 employees in 2023, and is offering internal mobility and training programmes to retain staff. Lemon Tree Hotels will also appoint 3,000 people as the companys room count increases from 8,500 to 10,500, says Chairman and MD Patanjali Keswani. Driven by the post-pandemic recovery in the industry, more stalled projects are now getting completed, says Mandeep Singh Lamba, MRICS, President (South Asia) of HVS Anarock. The consulting firm adds that 44% of new room additions will be in Tier 3 locations like Dehradun, Shillong, and Haridwar, among others. Around 10 lakh people are needed in the restaurant industry in the next three quarters, Anumeha Chaturvedi reports for The Economic Times, citing industry executives. Hiring growth is expected to increase by 10-15% during the upcoming festive season, according to Suchita Dutta, Executive Director of the Indian Staffing Federation. There is a shortage of talent at the junior levels across the sector, but the same isnt true at the mid to senior levels, says Nikhil Sharma, Market Managing Director-Eurasia at Wyndham Hotels & Resorts.

Companies, including tech firms, are hiring external AI specialists and skilling their workforce on AI. The AI roles in demand? Machine learning engineers, AI security specialists, AI infrastructure managers, AI writers, drone experts, and AI project managers, adds the report. L&T is utilising AI, machine learning, drone, analytics and robotics for pre-cast automation, welding, geospatial mapping, and digital manufacturing. The firm is looking for engineers in the core EPC and construction domains and those with exposure to new technologies, and is hiring for niche roles like AI architects, data scientists, AI infrastructure managers, and AI security specialists, said C Jayakumar, Executive Vice President and Head-Corporate HR. Mondelez India is working on building AI capabilities and workforce, and digital marketing and data science roles are in focus at the company. The company is keen to test and learn AI whether it's for sales or campaigns, said Nagina Singh, People Lead. How will this trend evolve? According to Randstad data, hiring intent for AI-centric roles in non-tech firms has increased 25-30% this year over last. The company expects this trend to pick up as more firms adopt automation and digitisation, said Yeshab Giri, Chief Commercial Officer, Staffing and Randstad Technologies. Indian enterprises increased their AI adoption, with industrial products and manufacturing witnessing the highest adoption rates post-pandemic, reports The Economic Times, citing a PwC survey. While sectors like technology, media, telecom, and healthcare and pharmaceutical have seen progress in AI adoption, the retail and consumer market saw a decline due to a gap in identifying potential use cases, according to the report.
