Piyush Mahajan shared a post: 🚀 Internship Journey: A Chapter Ends, Another Begins!
I can't believe it's been two months already! 🌟 This marks the end of an incredible internship at ConcCoder Services 🎉 I wanted to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude to my manager and the entire team for such an enriching experience.
🙌 Your guidance and mentorship have been invaluable. I've learned more than I could have imagined, not just about technology, but also about teamwork, dedication, and pushing beyond limits.
🌐 Product Innovation: Working on AI and Full Stack Products has been a journey of innovation and growth. I've had the chance to contribute to the Project and witness firsthand how a collaborative team can turn ideas into reality.
📈 Learning Curve: The learning curve was steep, but every challenge was an opportunity. I've gained insights that will undoubtedly shape my future endeavors.
🚀 Exciting Times Ahead: As this chapter closes, I'm thrilled about what the future holds. I'm leaving with a backpack full of skills, memories, and a heart full of gratitude.
Thank you, Team ConcCoder, for an unforgettable internship experience. Here's to the next adventure! 🌈✨

Don’t know who needs to hear this, but you need to put in efforts, develop specific skills like networking with people the right way, fine tuning your CV, when applying for a job! It doesn’t matter if you have a PhD. If you can’t showcase your skills, you won’t be hired.

Word clouds can provide a quick visual summary of the most prominent words in a text, making it easy to identify key themes, topics, or keywords.
𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬:
𝐒𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬: also known as opinion mining, is the process of determining the sentiment or emotional tone in a piece of text, such as positive, negative, or neutral.
𝐓𝐞𝐱𝐭𝐁𝐥𝐨𝐛'𝐬 sentiment analysis tool assigns two sentiment-related properties to the TextBlob object:
Polarity: This is a numerical value ranging from -1 (most negative) to 1 (most positive). A polarity of 0 represents a neutral sentiment. Positive values indicate positive sentiment, and negative values indicate negative sentiment.
𝐀𝐅𝐈𝐍𝐍 (Affective Norms for English Words) is a pre-built sentiment analysis tool that assigns precomputed sentiment scores to words in the English language. Each word is assigned a numeric score that represents its sentiment polarity, with positive scores indicating a positive sentiment and negative scores indicating a negative sentiment. AFINN is a simple and lightweight resource that can be used for basic sentiment analysis in NLP tasks.

In addition to lack of incentive mechanisms (or appreciation/recognition), perhaps another reason is the (false) perception that you don't need to be an expert in a subject/area to teach it and that teaching is a lower cognitive effort activity as compared to research.

Hotel chains across the country are ramping up recruitment, with new room additions slated to reach more than 14,000 this year, Aneesh Phadnis reports for businessline.
Indian Hotels Company Limited, which runs the Taj Group of Hotels, is planning to open 20 properties in FY24 and hire 2,500 direct employees. It has also started a leadership accelerator programme for professionals with MBA degrees, the report says.
The Accor Group, which operates brands like Novotel and ibis, is looking to hire 800 employees in 2023, and is offering internal mobility and training programmes to retain staff. Lemon Tree Hotels will also appoint 3,000 people as the company’s room count increases from 8,500 to 10,500, says Chairman and MD Patanjali Keswani.
Driven by the post-pandemic recovery in the industry, more stalled projects are now getting completed, says Mandeep Singh Lamba, MRICS, President (South Asia) of HVS Anarock. The consulting firm adds that 44% of new room additions will be in Tier 3 locations like Dehradun, Shillong, and Haridwar, among others.
Around 10 lakh people are needed in the restaurant industry in the next three quarters, Anumeha Chaturvedi reports for The Economic Times, citing industry executives. Hiring growth is expected to increase by 10-15% during the upcoming festive season, according to Suchita Dutta, Executive Director of the Indian Staffing Federation.
There is a shortage of talent at the junior levels across the sector, but the same isn’t true at the mid to senior levels, says Nikhil Sharma, Market Managing Director-Eurasia at Wyndham Hotels & Resorts.

Demand for AI talent from non-tech sectors like healthcare, retail, telecom, and Indian conglomerates is almost 50% higher than last year, according to Michael Page. Companies, including tech firms, are hiring external AI specialists and skilling their workforce on AI.
The AI roles in demand? Machine learning engineers, AI security specialists, AI infrastructure managers, AI writers, drone experts, and AI project managers, adds the report.
L&T is utilising AI, machine learning, drone, analytics and robotics for pre-cast automation, welding, geospatial mapping, and digital manufacturing. The firm is looking for engineers in the core EPC and construction domains and those with exposure to new technologies, and is hiring for niche roles like AI architects, data scientists, AI infrastructure managers, and AI security specialists, said C Jayakumar, Executive Vice President and Head-Corporate HR.
Mondelez India is working on building AI capabilities and workforce, and digital marketing and data science roles are in focus at the company. The company is keen to test and learn AI — whether it's for sales or campaigns, said Nagina Singh, People Lead.
How will this trend evolve? According to Randstad data, hiring intent for AI-centric roles in non-tech firms has increased 25-30% this year over last. The company expects this trend to pick up as more firms adopt automation and digitisation, said Yeshab Giri, Chief Commercial Officer, Staffing and Randstad Technologies.
Indian enterprises increased their AI adoption, with industrial products and manufacturing witnessing the highest adoption rates post-pandemic, reports The Economic Times, citing a PwC survey. While sectors like technology, media, telecom, and healthcare and pharmaceutical have seen progress in AI adoption, the retail and consumer market saw a decline due to a gap in identifying potential use cases, according to the report.

Congratulate Purva Chalindrawar for starting a new position as Management Trainee at Younity.in
Say congrats
Purva Chalindrawar shared a post: I am delighted to share that I have successfully completed an enriching internship at Younity.in, a remarkable journey that has been both educational and rewarding. During this period, I had the privilege of working under the mentorship of Amandeep Kaur Mam , whose guidance and expertise have been invaluable in shaping my professional growth. The internship provided me with a multifaceted learning experience, encompassing essential skills such as marketing, interpersonal communication, and relationship building. I am proud to mention that I contributed significantly to the organization's success by generating a commendable revenue of over 10K, showcasing my dedication and commitment to achieving tangible results.
This internship, which was stipend-based, not only allowed me to expand my horizons but also led to my promotion to the role of Management Trainee due to my exceptional performance. I am now serving as a team leader, where I can leverage my skills and experiences to drive further growth and success for the team and the organization. I am elated to have been recognized for my efforts with both a completion certificate and an excellence certificate, a testament to the quality of work I have delivered throughout this journey. These certificates serve as a testament to my dedication, competence, and accomplishments during this internship and I look forward to utilizing these experiences to contribute positively to future endeavors.
