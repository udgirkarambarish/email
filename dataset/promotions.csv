The project protocol: Documentation edit
Hello, efficiency experts!
It’s question time. Do you prefer performance updates or status reports?
In project documentation, we often think in a one-size-fits-all framework.
But when we force everything into the same template, we may lose the details
that matter most. There has to be more to documentation than just updates and
reports, right?
Yes, there is! 22 different formats of project documentation, to be exact.
💁🏽‍♂️
And we’re bringing them all to you (+ ready-to-use templates). Let’s get that
documentation going! Tell me more What's new in productivity? The Seinfeld strategy
What do great comedy and killer documentation have in common? Consistency!
Jerry Seinfeld built his legacy one daily joke at a time. Bring the same energy
to your documentation. TL;DR: Do not break the chain!
Learn more The goal gradient effect
Ever notice that extra burst of energy you get when nearing the finish line?
It's science! 🤓
Break your documentation into clear milestones with visual progress trackers,
and watch your team smash their goals.
Learn more LevelUp at work Power skills FTW
Writing clear documentation is just the start. You need power skills to get
teams moving in the same direction. The most successful projects don't just get
documented—they tell a story that drives action.

We’re donating $1 million to support online freedom and democracy,"[Proton](
Community update
Dear Proton supporter,
Since 2018, we have donated [over $4 million to support nonprofits]( aligned with Proton’s mission of privacy and freedom. While many organizations claim to champion these values, at Proton we believe actions speak louder than words and we’re the only encrypted email and VPN company that puts large amounts of money to back this up.
Thanks to the overwhelming success of the 2024 Lifetime charity fundraiser, this year, we’re [making our largest contribution ever]( at over $1 million dollars. This money is going to over a dozen nonprofits defending freedom and privacy that were selected by you. Some, like Free Press Unlimited, defend independent journalism, while others, like the Tech Oversight Project, support Proton’s longstanding efforts to combat the destructive influence of Big Tech.
Dr. Andy Yen

Following news of a TikTok ban in the US, many people are switching to a Chinese-owned alternative known as RedNote. But just like TikTok and many other social media apps, RedNote presents major risks to your privacy. The app monitors your location, browsing history, messages, and more.

Big Tech fines don’t work because they’re making billions
In 2024, governments worldwide imposed a record $8.2 billion in fines on Big Tech companies like Apple, Google, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft. But for these tech giants, the penalties are barely noticeable. According to our analysis of Big Tech revenues, Google can pay off its $3 billion in fines in just 17 days of business, and Amazon wiped out its $57 million penalty in a day.
These fines are little more than a cost of doing business for Big Tech, failing to deter their anti-competitive practices and privacy abuses. To hold these companies accountable, regulators must shift their focus from symbolic penalties to structural changes.
[Read how fines fall short and what needs to happen for real accountability](
Toward internet privacy for all in 2025
To succeed in our mission, we must build encrypted services that are simple and seamless for anyone to use, no matter your tech abilities. So, in 2025, we’re doubling down on making Proton a complete alternative to Big Tech because end-to-end encryption works best when everyone is using it. At the same time, we’re rolling out even stronger privacy protections and new technologies to fight censorship and government repression to ensure access to a free, open internet for all.
For those who are interested, we have recently posted winter roadmaps for each service so you can see what is coming:
- [Proton Mail and Calendar](
- [Proton VPN](
- [Proton Drive and Proton Docs](
- [Proton Pass](
Introducing track changes/suggestions in Proton Docs
With our latest update, Docs in Proton Drive is now the only online document editor that lets you see track changes and leave suggestions that are end-to-end encrypted, ensuring your work stays private and secure at every stage. Docs enables you to gather feedback and maintain a clear record of edits in real time — all while keeping sensitive information safe from breaches, surveillance, or unauthorized access. Whether you’re negotiating contracts, drafting reports, or collaborating on strategy documents, Docs protects your data while boosting your team’s productivity.
[Try Docs in Proton Drive today and collaborate with confidence](
Introducing single sign-on in Proton Pass for Business
Managing passwords and protecting your business from cybercrime just got easier. Single sign-on (SSO) is now available for Proton Pass Professional. SSO lets your employees securely access all their accounts with just one login, saving time, reducing password fatigue, and improving security. Employees no longer need to create/manage a new account for Proton Pass.
[Contact us to learn more about how Proton Pass can secure your business needs](
Proton Pass Family can protect your loved ones online
For a limited time, you can get Pass Family for just $3.99/month (on a 12-month plan). If you already pay for another password manager, you can easily [switch to Proton Pass and we’ll credit you]( for the remaining balance of your contract with the other password manager.

Save & share your best AI prompts
The power of AI hinges on the quality of your prompt. And great prompts can
get pretty complex. With our latest release, you can level up you and your
entire team's work bysaving and sharing AI prompt templates!
Why you’ll love it:
Save time: Save your favorite prompts and then apply them anytime you're using
ClickUp AI.
Stay consistent: Keep branding, style, and messaging on point across your
entire Workspace.
Share with everyone: Create a prompt once and let your whole Workspace use it.
How it works:
Create your template: What do you use AI for most? Especially consider things
that require a detailed prompt—maybe a specific style of writing or particular
status updates.

🤖 Aliaksandr Valialkin [  ] on X
Explore the rising influence of bots in software development, where a staggering 41% of comments in GitHub issues and 33% of git pushes are now generated by automated tools, reshaping the landscape of coding and collaboration.
🚀 You Want Modules, Not Microservices
Let's dissect the microservices trend to uncover its historical roots, the emphasis on organizational clarity, and the challenges of distributed computing that shape its impact on modern software development.
Celebrating 21 Years of Notepad++: The Legendary Journey of Our Favorite Text Editor (🔗 Read the Story [  ])
One of the most underrated yet indispensable tools in the digital world—Notepad++ celebrates 21 years as a trusted, feature-rich text editor. It marked its place as a true MVP for developers, writers, and anyone who’s ever needed a dependable place to jot things down. From groundbreaking features to community love, Notepad++ has earned its stripes, and then some.
Key Points
The early days: back to 2003’s roots: In a world before YouTube or iPhones, Don Ho created Notepad++ with a simple goal—to be powerful yet lightweight. built on Scintilla and written in C++, it quickly became a game-changer for efficiency-minded users.
Feature-packed & flexible: Whether it’s multi-document tabbing, syntax highlighting, or thousands of plugins, Notepad++ is both straightforward and sophisticated. need JSON readability or FTP integration? Notepad++ has a plugin for that.
Community-powered legacy: Staying relevant for two decades, Notepad++ thrives not on corporate backing but through its passionate open-source community. with countless contributions, it’s a tool built by its users, for its users—one we’ll happily use for years to come.
Linus Torvalds Lands A 2.6% Performance Improvement With Minor Linux Kernel Patch (🔗 Read the Story [  ])
This week, Linus Torvalds merged a new patch that promises a 2.6% performance boost for the Linux kernel, specifically within Intel’s “will it scale” per-thread-ops benchmark. The update tweaks the 64-bit copy_from_user() function, bypassing the slower barrier_nospec() to reduce overhead. This may sound like a small optimization, but every little improvement counts, especially in kernel performance. Let’s dive into the details of this recent change.
Key Points
Targeted optimization: The patch, inspired by an earlier proposal by kernel developer Josh Poimboeuf, focuses on using pointer masking instead of barrier_nospec() to streamline data transfer from user-space to kernel-space.
Benchmark results: With testing showing a 2.6% improvement in per-thread operations, this change could benefit both synthetic and real-world workloads, offering better performance without the spectre-mitigation overhead.
Upcoming release: Merged into the Linux Git repository, this patch will appear in the Linux 6.12-rc6 release next Sunday, with a stable Linux 6.12 release expected later this month.
Why Sprints Are Taking the Joy Out of Building Software (🔗 Read the Story [  ])
Software development teams often feel like they're stuck in a marathon disguised as a sprint—rushing through task after task, barely catching their breath before diving into the next cycle. While sprints are meant to embody the Agile spirit, some argue they’ve become a source of stress, focusing more on deadlines than quality and creativity. Let’s debunk the myth that sprints are essential to Agile and explore alternative workflows that encourage balance, productivity, and well-being. From companies like Basecamp to smaller teams, examples show there’s more than one way to organize work effectively.
Key Points
Rethinking sprints: Rather than emphasizing sprints, teams could focus on creating flexible, quality-driven cycles—like Basecamp’s six-week work periods followed by a cooldown phase for fixing and personal projects.
Alternative approaches: Smaller teams and even established companies like Basecamp show that releasing when features are ready, without rigid timelines, can result in thoughtful, high-quality output.
Making small changes: Even if you’re in a sprint-heavy environment, you can leave breathing room in sprints, skip unnecessary meetings, and occasionally dedicate entire sprints to quality improvements—incremental adjustments that can enhance team productivity and morale.
Aliaksandr Valialkin [  ] on X (🔗 Read the Story [  ])
In a recent analysis, Aliaksandr Valialkin highlighted the significant role of bots in GitHub's activity, revealing just how automated the coding world has become. According to his findings, a remarkable portion of GitHub interactions—especially comments, commits, and pull requests—are bot-generated, a trend largely driven by tools like Dependabot. This shift towards automation raises important questions about the future of coding and collaboration in open-source projects.
Key Points
Comments: Bots accounted for 41% of all comments on GitHub issues, reflecting automation's heavy hand in keeping conversations active and relevant.
Commits: About 33% of all git pushes were generated by bots, showing the extent to which automation supports software development.
Pull Requests: Over 30% of public pull requests in recent months were bot-driven, with Dependabot leading in creating and managing dependency updates.
You Want Modules, Not Microservices (🔗Read the Story [  ])
In software architecture, microservices have emerged as a hot topic, hailed as the ultimate solution for scalability and developer focus. However, as we dive deeper into this trend, it becomes evident that the benefits touted by microservices are not entirely new concepts; they have roots in decades-old practices. This analysis aims to unravel the true essence of microservices, shedding light on both their merits and the challenges they present, as well as how they relate to the broader context of software development.
Key Points
Not a new concept: Many advantages associated with microservices, such as scalability and reliability, have been discussed for years in the context of earlier technologies like EJB and Oracle Tuxedo. By recognizing this historical pattern, we can better understand the motivations behind the current microservices trend.
Organizational clarity: Microservices are more about promoting independent development teams than about architectural principles. The emphasis is on reducing dependencies that slow down progress, allowing teams to own their entire workflow, from coding to deployment, and adapt quickly to changes.
Fallacies of distributed computing: While microservices aim to improve performance and scalability, they also introduce new challenges related to latency and communication across distributed systems. Understanding these pitfalls is crucial for teams considering a transition to a microservices architecture, as the complexities can outweigh the perceived benefits.

"😎 Microsoft’s New OpenHCL, OOP’s Power & 3 More","View this post on the web at 
Welcome to HackerPulse Dispatch, your weekly slice of the latest news and trends in the tech world!
Here’s what new:
💨 How Is This Website So Fast!? — Breaking down the McMaster Carr Website and the Techniques They Use to Make It So Dang Fast: In a world where slow-loading websites mean lost sales, McMaster-Carr is proving that speed doesn’t always require the latest tech.
#️⃣ Microsoft Has Open Sourced Its New Cross-Platform Virtual Machine Layer Written in Rust: Meet Microsoft’s new open-source paravisor, OpenHCL, enhances virtualization for confidential computing by enabling secure VM workloads without frequent OS updates.
👻 Software Engineer Titles Have (Almost) Lost All Their Meaning: The inflation of software engineer titles is eroding career clarity and industry integrity, creating mismatched expectations and undermining authentic growth.
🤬  Using AI Generated Code Will Make You a Bad Programmer: Did you know that the reliance on AI-generated code undermines personal growth, devalues programming skills, and leads to a lack of respect from peers?
😏 OOP Is Not That Bad, Actually: Explore the essential strengths of mainstream statically-typed Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), promoting backward compatibility and flexibility in collaborative coding.
How Is This Website So Fast!? — Breaking down the McMaster Carr Website and the Techniques They Use to Make It So Dang Fast (🔗 Read the Story [  ])
When Kenneth Cassel, founder of rmfg.com, tweeted about McMaster-Carr’s surprisingly snappy online shopping experience, it sparked a lively debate on Twitter.
For those unfamiliar with the century-old industrial supplies company, McMaster-Carr has been quietly excelling at customer experience for decades—ranked just behind Amazon and Barnes & Noble back in 2002.
But what’s catching attention now is how the site combines old-school design with cutting-edge performance, defying modern web trends.
Key Points
Old tools, new tricks: McMaster-Carr’s site runs on ASP.NET with JavaScript powered by jQuery and the vintage YUI library—technology many consider outdated, yet performing exceptionally well.
Under the hood: Key optimizations, like server-side rendering, prefetching links, and CDN caching, ensure users experience lightning-fast interactions without modern bloat.
A lesson for the web: McMaster-Carr’s success shows that practical performance engineering beats trendy frameworks—reminding us that websites don’t need flashiness to impress.
Microsoft Has Open Sourced Its New Cross-Platform Virtual Machine Layer Written in Rust (🔗 Read the Story [  ])
Virtualization has been the backbone of cloud computing from the start, allowing workloads to run efficiently in virtual machines (VMs).
Now, Microsoft is pushing the boundaries with a novel solution called the ""paravisor,"" aimed at addressing the limitations of confidential computing.
Microsoft’s new open-source paravisor, OpenHCL, embedded within the VM’s secure boundary, ensures that both older and newer operating systems can leverage confidential computing without frequent updates or disruptions.
Key Points
OpenHCL: unified solution for all VMs: OpenHCL bridges the gap between confidential and non-confidential VMs, offering device emulation, performance enhancements, and compatibility for legacy OS versions without requiring modifications.
Collaborative hardware support: OpenHCL already supports Intel TDX, AMD SEV-SNP, and ARM CCA, with ongoing collaboration to optimize performance across multiple architectures.

The title of ""Senior Software Engineer"" once carried weight, signaling deep expertise, years of hands-on experience, and a readiness to lead.
However, in recent years, title inflation has run rampant, leaving the industry grappling with a devaluation of roles. Developers with only a few years of experience are being given senior titles, diluting what those titles once represented and muddling the path for career growth.
The problem isn’t just confusing—it’s reshaping industry dynamics, creating mismatches between expectations and real-world abilities.
Key Points
Misaligned expectations: With inflated titles, junior employees are often thrust into responsibilities they’re unprepared for, leading to poor performance, burnout, and team disruptions. A lack of clarity in role expectations hurts not only those employees but also the teams they lead.
Toward authentic growth frameworks: Leaders and HR teams must prioritize transparent career paths tied to skills and responsibilities, rather than resorting to hollow titles. Companies that resist title inflation cultivate stronger teams, attract top talent, and build reputations rooted in trust and excellence.
Using AI Generated Code Will Make You a Bad Programmer (🔗Read the Story [  ])
In a provocative opinion piece, Rudis Muiznieks critiques the reliance on AI-generated code, arguing that it undermines personal growth and the integrity of programming as a craft.
While AI tools can streamline mundane tasks, the author contends that over-dependence on them not only stifles learning but also fosters a culture of superficial coding without genuine understanding.
Key Points
Developers rob themselves of learning opportunities: Relying on AI-generated code limits growth and understanding, akin to ""script kiddies"" who use pre-written tools without grasping their functionality.
Skills developers already have may atrophy: Regularly writing code, even the boring bits, is essential to maintaining and improving programming skills, as neglect leads to forgetfulness and diminished abilities.
Developers’ code will not be respected: Using AI tools may result in a lack of respect from peers, as true pride and accomplishment in programming come from creating code independently.
OOP Is Not That Bad, Actually (🔗 Read the Story [  ])
In a recent post, the author reflects on the merits of mainstream statically-typed Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), arguing that it offers essential advantages for collaborative programming over extended periods.
While the author may not favor the OOP paradigm, they acknowledge that certain features are crucial for developing composable libraries and maintaining backward compatibility.
Through a comparative analysis with Haskell, the author aims to illustrate that OOP is often misjudged by functional programmers.
Key Points
OOP provides essential features: The core features of OOP, such as classes, inheritance, subtyping, and virtual calls, enable developers to create flexible and maintainable code that can evolve without disrupting existing functionality.
Backward compatibility is key: The OOP approach allows developers to extend libraries with new functionalities while ensuring that existing code remains functional, fostering an environment conducive to collaboration and long-term projects.
Functional programming needs to embrace OOP successes: The author advocates for the functional programming community to recognize the successful aspects of OOP, emphasizing that understanding these strengths can lead to better practices in the industry.

Maximizing SYCL Portability Across High Performance Platforms
October 15, 2024, from 9:00am to 11:00am PT.
Reserve your seat to attend"""" [Time zone converter ]
Today, many high-performance computers (HPC) are equipped with multiple CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and other accelerators. The challenge for developers is ensuring the right mix of portability, performance, and productivity. This workshop focuses on coding techniques with SYCL that take advantage of existing accelerators and boost performance in HPC systems, maximizing portability across diverse platforms.
With the Intel® Tiber™ AI Cloud, developers gain hands-on experience featuring the latest Intel hardware and software, including a comprehensive open ecosystem environment and a complement of CPUs and GPUs. Developers are encouraged to access their own Nvidia or AMD GPU system—with the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit installed—to run SYCL code comparatively on these systems.
Key takeaways
*Use SYCL code to target different devices and modify environment variables
*Retrieve device properties, optimizing SYCL kernels for various offload devices
*Install the oneAPI plugin that lets you build code for Nvidia or AMD GPUs
*Offload SYCL code and GPU computations to support different vendors—including Intel, Nvidia, and AMD
*Introduce supplemental SYCL development tools, such as Intel® VTune™ Profiler and SYCLomatic
The workshop is geared to intermediate to advanced developers. The session offers the knowledge and expertise to harness SYCL effectively for creating portable code ideal for high performance systems."

Keep reading to learn what else happened during September.
--- image...
New roles
We’ve introduced Roles, a feature designed to bring granular permissions to the Appwrite Console, which is available for both the Pro and Scale plans. Alongside the existing owner role, you can now assign these new roles to your team members:
- Developer

To celebrate the new feature, you can invite members with the new roles to your Pro teams for free until the end of the year.

CCPA
Appwrite is now fully CCPA-compliant, bringing you even more security and peace of mind when building your apps.
The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) (  ) is a landmark data privacy law that enhances consumer rights for residents of California.
Read the announcement (  )
---Product updates
1.5.11 Security patch
A security issue was discovered in open-runtimes/executor that caused error stack traces to be included in build and execution logs, potentially exposing sensitive information.
For Appwrite Cloud users, we have deployed a security patch and rotated affected keys to prevent misuse, and we've confirmed that there was no exploitation of this issue, so no action is needed on your part.
If you are using a self-hosted Appwrite instance, we strongly recommend upgrading to version 1.5.11 to implement the security patch and prevent any further exposure. This upgrade is straightforward and requires no migrations or additional steps.
Check out the release notes (  )
---Updating collection attribute names and sizes
You can now update attribute names and sizes directly from your Cloud Console.
This update provides better flexibility in managing your data models, allowing you to adjust attributes without needing to recreate them or handle complicated migrations.
This is just one of a series of updates we plan to release for Appwrite databases over the next few weeks.
---Community recognitions
This month, we’re excited to feature Paralino by Zelimir (  ) as part of our Monthly Community Recognitions.
Paralino is a privacy focused, end-to-end encrypted location-sharing and family safety app. The first version is built for Android (iOS version coming soon) and is powered fully by Appwrite.
Check it out and download the application on Google Play (  ).
If you'd like to participate in next month's Community Recognitions, join our Discord server (  ) to showcase your project.

"September Changelog: Maintenance mode, Environment isolation, Manual service previews","---
We'd love to hear about your experience with Render! Let us know
what’s working and where we can improve. It's quick, we promise:
---
Hey everyone,
Today we're highlighting updates that expand your operational controls
for networking, logging, database storage, and more.
Let's take a look:
# Opt in to flexible PostgreSQL plans
Our new flexible PostgreSQL plans offer many more compute and storage
choices and will be available very soon. You can access the new plans
right now by following these steps:
# Create previews only for specific pull requests
Service previews and preview environments are fantastic for testing code
changes, but not every change needs a preview. To save costs, you can
now spin up previews only for PRs with `[render preview]` in their
title.
See the docs:
# Block private network traffic between environments
Organize your services into different environments, then isolate those
environments from each other on your private network. Now, you can ensure
your staging apps never write to a production database (or vice versa).
See the docs:
# Pause inbound requests with maintenance mode
Making complex backend changes that require downtime? You can now let your
users know simply by turning on maintenance mode. Serve Render's default
maintenance page to your users or specify your own.
See the docs:
# Customize log streaming for individual services
If you use log streams to forward logs to a provider like Datadog, you can
now customize the behavior for each service:
- Professional workspaces can disable log streaming for individual services.
- Organization and Enterprise workspaces can set a custom log stream
destination for individual services.
See the docs:
# Get to know our team
- Near San Francisco? Join us this Friday evening for a developer meetup
hosted by Render and our friends at WorkOS. RSVP here:
- Anywhere else? Listen to our founder Anurag Goel share Render's history
and long-term vision on the Code Story podcast:

Maximizing SYCL Portability Across High Performance Platforms
October 15, 2024, from 9:00am to 11:00am PT.
Reserve your seat to attend"""" [Time zone converter ]
Today, many high-performance computers (HPC) are equipped with multiple CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and other accelerators. The challenge for developers is ensuring the right mix of portability, performance, and productivity. This workshop focuses on coding techniques with SYCL that take advantage of existing accelerators and boost performance in HPC systems, maximizing portability across diverse platforms.
With the Intel® Tiber™ Developer Cloud, developers gain hands-on experience featuring the latest Intel hardware and software, including a comprehensive open ecosystem environment and a complement of CPUs and GPUs. Developers are encouraged to access their own Nvidia or AMD GPU system—with the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit installed—to run SYCL code comparatively on these systems.
Key takeaways
*Use SYCL code to target different devices and modify environment variables
*Retrieve device properties, optimizing SYCL kernels for various offload devices
*Install the oneAPI plugin that lets you build code for Nvidia or AMD GPUs
*Offload SYCL code and GPU computations to support different vendors—including Intel, Nvidia, and AMD
*Introduce supplemental SYCL development tools, such as Intel® VTune™ Profiler and SYCLomatic
The workshop is geared to intermediate to advanced developers. The session offers the knowledge and expertise to harness SYCL effectively for creating portable code ideal for high performance systems."

☄️ Is AI Generating Chaos in Businesses?,"View this post on the web at 
Here’s what new:
♻️ Stop Designing Your Web Application for Millions of Users When You Don’t Even Have 100: Explore why you should build for today, not tomorrow, and focus on your first 100 users before worrying about scaling for millions.
🙌 How Discord Reduced Websocket Traffic by 40%: Discord's engineering team turbocharged mobile performance by switching to zstandard compression, boosting speed and reducing data usage.
😕 AI-Generated Code is Causing Outages and Security Issues in Businesses: Businesses using AI for coding are experiencing downtime and security issues due to insufficient code reviews and accountability.
🌌 Correlation Does Not Imply Causation: Understanding the difference between correlation and causation is crucial for making informed decisions, as misinterpretations can lead to misguided actions based on spurious relationships in data.
📈 The Arrival of Java 23: Oracle has launched JDK 23, featuring twelve enhancements, including new language features and improved performance with the Z Garbage Collector.
Stop Designing Your Web Application for Millions of Users When You Don’t Even Have 100 (🔗 Read Paper [  ])
It’s easy to get caught up in building for the future, imagining millions of users and endless growth. But if you're still trying to land your first 100 users, preparing for scale may be premature. Over-engineering early on can cost you valuable time, money, and focus. Instead, it’s best to prioritize the present. Here’s why scaling later is smarter than over-preparing now.
Key Points
Don’t design on assumptions: In the early stages, you're guessing at what users need. Focus on delivering real value now and worry about scale once you have clear data from your user base.
Over-engineering is wasted time: Time spent building for millions is time taken away from refining your product. Build for your current users and adjust as you grow.
Costs pile up fast: Investing in large-scale infrastructure before it's necessary drains resources. Use that money on development and user acquisition instead.
How Discord Reduced Websocket Traffic by 40% (🔗 Read Paper [  ])
Over the last six months, Discord’s engineering team embarked on a journey to reduce bandwidth usage for mobile clients, specifically iOS and Android. With the hope that this would create a smoother, more responsive user experience, the team explored new methods of compression that could minimize data usage.
Key Points
Initial Testing with zstandard: Discord tested zstandard but found its performance underwhelming compared to zlib, later identifying the lack of streaming compression as the root cause.
Dark Launches and Experimentation: By conducting dark launches and exploring zstandard’s streaming features, Discord achieved better compression ratios and faster performance across clients.
Dictionary Support Challenges: Although adding dictionary support gave mixed results, Discord ultimately succeeded in rolling out zstandard across all platforms, improving connections for both mobile and desktop users.
AI-Generated Code is Causing Outages and Security Issues in Businesses (🔗 Read Paper [  ])
As more businesses turn to AI for coding, concerns over its reliability are growing. Tariq Shaukat, CEO of Sonar, is hearing firsthand how companies using AI code generation are encountering downtime and security risks. Studies show AI often makes mistakes, with even major institutions falling victim to inconsistent code quality.
Key Points
Ai-generated code issues: Businesses are facing outages due to AI-generated code, especially in critical systems. While AI speeds up coding, it often leads to bugs and security vulnerabilities.
Review practices: Developers are conducting fewer reviews of AI-written code, which increases security risks. A lack of robust quality control processes makes systems unstable.
Developer mindset: Many developers feel less accountable for buggy AI code, blaming the tools instead. This detachment can lead to critical errors going unnoticed and causing significant disruptions.
Correlation Does Not Imply Causation (🔗 Read Paper [  ])
Key Points
Correlation vs. causation: Correlation is a statistical measure that indicates a relationship between two variables, but it does not imply that one causes the other. Misunderstanding this can lead to faulty conclusions.
Spurious correlations: Spurious correlations occur when two variables appear related but lack a real-world connection. These coincidences can mislead decision-makers if not critically evaluated.
The Arrival of Java 23 (🔗 Read Paper [  ])
Oracle is excited to announce the general availability of JDK 23, bringing significant enhancements to developers, enterprises, and end-users. With twelve noteworthy JDK Enhancement Proposals (JEPs), this release introduces eight preview features and one incubator feature, showcasing improvements in the Java language, APIs, and performance tools. The inclusion of the Oracle GraalVM JIT compiler enhances the JDK's capabilities, providing developers with advanced performance optimization tools.
Key Points

Replit Starter Plan Changes,"Hello,
We’re reaching out to tell you about changes to your Starter plan.
What is changing?
* Number of Repls: The Starter plan is now limited to 3 Repls. Upgrade to
Core for unlimited* Repls.
* Collaboration limits: 1 collaborator per Starter account, 3 for Core, and
your entire org for Teams.
* Storage retention: Repls will be subject to deletion after 1 year of
inactivity on the Starter plan.
* Deployments:
*  Starter plan users can Deploy a single static site without a credit card
on file (1 GiB outbound data transfer limit). This change will roll out in the
next few weeks.
* Autoscale, Reserved VM, and Scheduled Deployments now need to be tied to a
Core account. If you have active Deployments of these types, you’ll receive a
separate email with more details.
* Development
*  Development time: The Starter plan is limited to 600 development minutes
per month. Upgrade to Core for no development time limits.
* Development outbound data transfer: changing Starter plan limit to 1 GiB.
* Development storage: changing the Starter plan limit to 2 GiBs.
Unless mentioned above, these changes will fully take effect on August 26th.
We understand that this may impact how you use Replit. We've carefully
considered these adjustments to ensure we can continue providing a sustainable
platform for all our users.
For a full overview of the changes, see replit.com/pricing <>. If you have any
questions about the changes, please reach out to support@replit.com
The Replit Team
FAQs:
Q: Will my Repls be deleted tomorrow if I haven't used the platform in a year?
A: No. We will send a heads-up email at least 30 days prior to any deletion
events.
Q: I'm over the 3 Repl limit. Will my Repls be deleted?
A: No. Your Repls that are over the new Starter plan limit will not be
deleted. You will still have access to your Repls.
Q: What does ""active"" mean in the context of the storage retention policy?
A: As long as you log into Replit at least once per year, your Repls will not
be deleted.
*Regarding “unlimited” Repls — there is technically a high upper bound that
almost 0 people will hit."

Programming and Optimizing Multi-GPU Applications with SYCL
July 25, 2024, from 9:00am to 11:00am PT.
Reserve your seat to attend"""" [Time zone converter ]
Exploit the processor resources of a system by taking advantage of the full complement of GPUs. Using SYCL, unlock the coding possibilities with the support of Intel® Tiber™ Developer Cloud (ITDC), loaded with the latest hardware, including 4th Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors and Intel® Data Center GPU Max 1100.
Aimed at intermediate to advanced programmers, this session demystifies the process of ensuring that computing workloads are distributed equitably, regardless of how many GPUs are in a system.
Key takeaways:
*Determine available GPUs for offloading compute tasks
*Assign compute kernels to multiple GPUs with SYCL code
*Use SYCL code to split workloads across multiple GPUs
*Write portable SYCL code that taps available GPUs resources
*Optimize SYCL code to execute kernels concurrently across the full range of GPUs
Developers can take advantage of expert guidance and hands-on experience with the solid resources of the ITDC. Broaden your understanding of SYCL and the coding secrets that unleash the true computational power of any system."

Reserve your seat to attend"""" [Time zone converter ]
Take maximum advantage of the resources available on a PC to perform AI operations and implement LLMs to power applications such as Chatbot, Stable Diffusion, and Speech 2 Text. The addition of neural processing units (NPUs), such Intel® Core™ Ultra processors, for unleashing capabilities formerly limited to cloud applications is a landmark achievement.
The challenge of deploying LLMs, which tend to be very large, on a PC or laptop with minimal resources is a key concern for developers right now and a subject of lively discussions. This workshop targets the relevant issues and shows the value of the NPU in providing the necessary computational power to contend with this challenge on a local level.
Key takeaways:
*Understand the fundamentals of Intel NPUs and the acceleration offered by Intel® Core™ Ultra processors
*Learn the significance of LLMs
*Create rapid prototypes with the NPU Acceleration Library
*Build LLM system partitions and applications
*Leverage OpenVINO and the NPU plugin for enhanced performance

Learn about the rise of agentic AI workflows and multimodal LLMs
An emerging paradigm in Generative AI is the rise of Agentic AI workflows: where different AI models act as agents to cooperate, plan, and execute to solve complex tasks. These agents can make use of foundation AI models - like large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs - to perform project planning for tool usage and self reflection. Multimodal LLMs are particularly useful when an enterprise has data in modalities other than text, such as videos, images, audio recordings, slides, diagrams, tables, and charts.
In this webinar, attendees will learn:
*What agentic AI frameworks are
*How agentic frameworks can solve for vision tasks
*How to understand the effectiveness of multimodal LLMs with interactive tools
*How to detect multimodal LLM bias and hallucinations

Solve Heterogeneous Programming Challenges with Fortran and OpenMP -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GPU offload strategy, 7-minute read
Fortran remains a popular choice for high-performance computing because it’s well-suited to sophisticated numeric computation on CPUs. Offloading Fortran code to a GPU, however, poses a challenge for domain scientists and other general programmers. This paper illustrates a solution: using directive-based programming techniques and OpenMP. Includes the steps and code sample.

🥲 Don't miss out on Web Awesome Pro — 6 hours left! 🥹,"Over the years, I've had several folks tell me they missed out on the OG Font Awesome Pro Kickstarter. So I promised I'd do my best to make sure folks know when we ran our next campaign. And, it's been a lot of emails, but you only get one shot at some things in life. Like backing the Web Awesome Kickstarter [ ending in just 6 hours.
After the Kickstarter ends, Web Awesome Pro goes from $99/yr to preorder pricing at $159/yr. And all Font Awesome Pro deals disappear. It's the last chance to get this price.

(Or early for our friends in the EU! 👋) The thing is ... we've been a little wired and can't sleep because we're so pumped about finishing strong on the Web Awesome Kickstarter [ And there's just 12 hours left!
Right now, WA Pro is $99/yr. After the Kickstarter ends, we’ll move on to preorder pricing at $159/yr.
Web Awesome not your thing? Lock in a Font Awesome Pro subscription for just $49 or WA Pro + FA Pro for just $149/yr. After the Kickstarter ends, both of these deals go away forever.

🔑 18 hours left to reach the Date Picker stretch goal! (Redo) 🔓,"Welp, you all did it. The Web Awesome Kickstarter [ has officially passed $600k, which has unlocked the WA Pro Combobox / Typeahead component AND another component added to WA Free AND a new starting theme and color palette added to Pro! Seriously outstanding work.
But we’re not done yet. Not by a long shot. With less than 18 hours to go, we’ve got just enough time to get to the $700k goal to reach the single most requested WA Pro component, the Date Picker!
This one's going to be a doozy. Getting the UX right on a Date Picker is hard enough. Getting the accessibility right is an absolutely enormous challenge. But this is the kind of challenge we live for.
There’s less than 18 hours left to get the Web Awesome Kickstarter [ pricing. Right now, WA Pro is $99/yr. After the Kickstarter ends, we’ll move on to preorder pricing at $159/yr, which is still a huge savings.
Web Awesome not your thing? No sweat. Right now, you can lock in a Font Awesome Pro only subscription for just $49 or WA Pro + FA Pro for just $149/yr. After the Kickstarter ends, both of these deals go away forever.
But why pay more later, when you can get the best deal right now? Plus, you get to back open source and make Web Awesome even more awesome. Everyone wins!

Minimize multimodal LLMs hallucinations and bias
Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to create disruptive impacts for enterprises. However, enterprise data exists in modalities other than text; it spans a range of modalities such as videos, audio recordings, and slides with diagrams, tables, and charts. For AI assistants and chatbots, it is essential to develop multimodal LLMs that can handle diverse data types effectively while minimizing bias and hallucinations.
In this webinar, attendees will learn how to:
*Use multimodal LLMs such as LLaVA that can chat with images or videos
*Understand the effectiveness of multimodal LLMs with interactive tools
*Detect multimodal LLM bias and hallucinations with insights on LLMs text output performance
*Probe and mitigate social biases by using synthetic counterfactual data

The one thing founders don’t understand about startup equity
If you’re a startup founder, you’ve heard this for years: the percentage of the company you own is essential. Startup equity and ownership play crucial roles, but it might shock you when I say founders get this wrong.
Sadly, most founders don't correctly understand equity because they see it all wrong. Most founders see startup equity as a pie chart, but a pie chart is an overly simplified approach to a company. Though it may be tougher to grasp, there’s another, better way to look at a startup.
What do startup founders get wrong about equity?
Let’s use two business types as examples: an LLC and a C-Corp. Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) protect their owners from responsibility should the company have debts or liabilities, hence the name.
An LLC is like a partnership and is usually split in percentages, so it’s closer to the pie chart example we used earlier. Each partner has a determined percentage of the company.
However, most startups aren't LLCs. Instead, they are C-corporations, a legal structure in which the owners, or shareholders, are taxed separately from the entity. Here’s a new, essential term: shareholders. They're vital for a startup, and that’s when it all changes.
Instead of seeing startups like a pie chart, viewing them as bricks is better.
How do startups split their shares?
The first thing to understand is that startup equity doesn't work in percentages but in company shares. For example, Founder A and Founder B create and split one company equally. Each gets ten shares, and the percentages are 50% for each.
Neither founder’s shares ever change hands. Instead, the company will create new shares if an investor comes in. Both founders still have ten shares, and investor C will get new shares. So, the shares remain the same, but the percentages change.
Founders A and B will no longer own 50% of the company, though each still has ten shares. That’s where valuation plays a crucial role in defining how much percentage the investor gets.
Startup valuations and how they impact shares
Startup valuations are easier to understand using Facebook as an example. When Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin started Facebook, they agreed to a 70/30 split on their founder equity.
Peter Thiel was one of the first investors in Facebook. He agreed to give them $510,000, which would eventually become approximately 10% of the company.
However, startups deal with shares, not percentages. So, $510,000 has to equate to some shares. The question is: how many?
When Thiel decided to invest, Facebook had no revenue or assets. That's why valuations relate to the company's potential.
A startup valuation is like betting odds: agreeing on how much to risk and what the reward will be if the investor, in this case, Thiel, is right. It’s the risk he’s willing to take.
Founders usually keep most of the shares for motivation and security. So, it's common for investors to get a small part of the company first. With Facebook, Zuckerberg and Thiel agreed that 10% of the company equated to around $500,000.
If $500,000 is 10% of the company, the entire company is worth $5,000,000. That's the post-money valuation because it's assuming the money is already part of the business.
On the other hand, pre-money valuation is the estimated value of a company before investor money is involved, which in Facebook’s case was $4,500,000.
We actually made a video explaining how Facebook's equity shifted and changed during their early days:
(  )
Using Facebook as an example for startup equity
Let's assume that Mark Zuckerberg, Eduardo Saverin, and the rest established the company with 100 shares.
Since the company’s pre-money is $4,500,000, each share is worth $45,000. So, Thiel’s $500,000 is enough to buy 11 shares ($495,000. These are rough estimates).
Facebook creates the shares and sells them to Peter Thiel. Now, the company has 111 shares, and Peter owns 9,9% of those shares.
Eduardo Saverin originally had 30 shares, which equated to 30%. He still has the 30 shares, but their value has dropped to around 27%.
Shares usually don’t change over time, but the percentage they represent gets smaller as more shares get created. The same applies to startup stock options.
*So, how do startup stock options work?*
First, let’s clear one thing: giving stock options doesn’t mean employees get shares in the business. Rather, it’s the option to buy them at a pre-determined price called a ""strike price.""
Let's say Facebook gave one employee the option of buying 30,000 shares at a strike price of $0.89. When Facebook went public, the price per share was $38. So, stock option owners could buy for $0.89 and then sell for $38, netting massive profits.
Stock options are enticing and advantageous as long as the company increases in value. That's why companies love increasing their valuation, but it doesn't always turn out well. At one point, WeWork was worth $47 billion, and we all know what happened.

"Impossible Cubes, Liminal Bytes, and Candy Toggles",".content {
.byline {
}
}
} That .byline selector probably doesn’t gain anything by being nested like that. Break it out of there and it’ll be more re-usable and easier to override if you need to. But this: .card {
@container (width > 60ch) {
}
} Is probably good! It just saves you from having to re-write the .card selector again. Scott gets more in-depth though with more examples and I largely agree. How do you adjust an existing color light and darker? I’m a biiiig fan of the relative color syntax , which is great at this job, but before I go on a tangent about that, it’s not well supported yet so let’s not. It’s on the Interop 2024 list though! Better supported is color-mix() , and Cory LaViska has the story on using it for this job : Using color-mix() , we can adjust the tint/shade based on the background color, meaning we don’t need to manually select lighter/darker colors for those states. And because we’re using OKLCH, the variations will be perceptually uniform, unlike HSL . By mixing white and black into colors, and doing it in the OKLCH color space, we can essentially tint and shade the colors and know that we’re doing it evenly across any color we have. This is as opposed to the days when a lot of us tried to use darken() and such in Sass only to find extremely different results across colors. How are the final values of Custom Properties calculated? Stephanie Eckles: Custom properties – aka “CSS variables” – seem fairly straightforward. However, there are some behaviors to be aware of regarding how the browser computes the final values. A misunderstanding of this process may lead to an unexpected or missing value and difficulty troubleshooting and resolving the issue. Custom Properties follow the cascade and are computed at runtime, for one thing, which is the whole reason that they cannot be preprocessed ahead of time. But it’s more complex than that. What if the value is valid for a custom property (most anything is), but not valid for the way you are trying to use it? This is a real head scratcher: html {
color: red;
}
p {
color: blue;
}
.card {
--color: #notacolor;
}
.card p {
color: var(--color);
} Turns out .card p will actually be red (I would have guessed blue), but Stephanie explains: The .card p will be the inherited color value of red as provided by the body . It is unable to use the cascaded value of blue due to the browser discarding that as a possible value candidate at “parse time” when it is only evaluating syntax. How do you accommodate people who struggle with transparent interfaces? Adam Argyle explains it can be like this , using this media query you may or may not have heard of: .example {
--opacity: 0.5;
background: hsl(200 100% 50% / var(--opacity));
@media (prefers-reduced-transparency: reduce) {
--opacity: 0.95;
}
} Adam had lots of practical examples in the post, and does consider that word reduced , and how it doesn’t mean absolutely none ever . What units should you use for spacing properties? Me, I just use rem usually as that’s what I use for nearly everything else. But Ashlee M Boyer argues that while stuff like text makes good sense to use relative units, spacing need not scale at that same rate: When a user is customizing their viewing experience, they thing that’s most important to them and their task at hand is the content. Spacing isn’t often vital for a user to perform their task, so it doesn’t need to grow or scale at the same rate as the content itself. When spacing between content grows, it eats up vital real estate and becomes harder to manage. Ashlee proves it with a before video and an after video , after being moving relative units to absolute units for spacing. How do you make every Sass file automatically include common imports? This one hits home for me, as someone with a codebase with easily hundreds of Sass files that all start with something like @import ""@codepen/variables""; Wouldn’t it be cool if Sass could just assume we wanted to do that for every file? Austin Gil covered this a while back on doing it with Vite . When you define your Vite config, you can like: css: {
preprocessorOptions: {
scss: {
additionalData: `@import ""@/assets/_shared.scss"";`;
}
}"

The battle for truth: how AI startups are fighting election interference
(  )
🗳️AI startups are increasingly engaged in politics, and with roughly 49% of the global population heading to the polls (  ) , the issue takes on significant importance on the global agenda.
Anthropic, an AI startup, is piloting a feature to combat election misinformation. Their technology, ""Prompt Shield,"" identifies when users of its GenAI chatbot, Claude, ask about political topics, and redirects them to ""authoritative"" sources for voting data. The move stems from Claude's limitations in providing up-to-date political information.
This shift is part of a larger trend in the AI industry to curb election interference. Similar efforts are in play at OpenAI which prohibits the use of its tools for political campaigning. The stakes are high, globally, with a record number of voters heading to the polls this year. The use of GenAI tools in political campaigns remains a contentious issue and, in the U.S., regulation is yet to catch up.
This self-regulation by AI companies underscores the growing realization of the potential misuse of AI technology in politics. (  ) Policymakers, platform owners, and AI developers should be vigilant in ensuring responsible usage and deployment of AI tools.

Startup Club: The painful road from Pitch Deck to Funding
(  )
Whether you're in the early stages or gearing up for a seed round, this video is packed with valuable advice from a venture-backed founder who's been through it all, not once but twice. Dive into the real work behind startup funding, understand investor expectations, and how to prepare for success. Essential viewing for founders seeking venture capital.
Our new Startup Club Newsletter (  ) goes out twice a week, and it coveres the state of startup fundraising, and the stories that are capturing interest from investors.

2024, it’s in the game!
(  )
Advancing through levels in a video game requires as much skill as it does hope. Those two characteristics are present in venture capital investors envisioning a more promising 2024 for the video game industry. While it's true that there were better years than 2023 for startups in this industry, considering fundraising compared to previous years, that doesn't diminish investors' confidence. They consider significant milestones from last year (  ) , such as releasing relevant titles like Baldur's Gate 3 and Hogwarts Legacy (each selling over 22 million copies).
The industry is shifting towards cross-platform games (  ) , which, while expensive, are also more lucrative. Another point in favor is the availability of talent in the market, considering the number of developers available after mass layoffs in other areas in 2023.
Adding to this is the integration of artificial intelligence to continue advancing game development and innovation. Could 2024 be when the gaming industry jumps to the next level?

Feeding the AI Beast
(  )
A booming data market is emerging to feed hungry AI models, with companies like Meta and OpenAI needing massive datasets to train their models. New York City-based startup, Nomad Data, has built large language models to match over 2,500 data vendors to data buyers (  ). The company offers data discovery, allowing companies to search for specific types of data in natural language.
Nomad's CEO, Brad Schneider, highlights that the true value lies not in the training data, but in the constant feeding of live data (inference) to AI models for predictions or task-solving. He also emphasized the increasing importance of customized training of AI models using specific datasets.
This data market phenomenon has led to a surge of data vendors, including media outlets and corporations. Nomad Data's business model revolves around using AI to find new data vendors. Schneider predicts that the market's most exciting part will be the utilization of previously invaluable data in business operations due to new technology. (  )

Register now! pen Squircle with a border on hover Mustafa Enes crafts a squircle-shaped image surrounded by a golden border that pops in pleasingly on hover. pen CSS Party David East declares 2024 the ""Year of CSS"" and gives you the option to set the level of party or chill in this fun interactive Pen. Chris’ Corner A collection of web design and development news and thoughts from CodePen's own Chris Coyier. It’s January and we’re seeing a little round of CSS wishlists make the rounds. Tyler Sticka is mostly hoping for better support on stuff that already is starting to cook, like View Transitions, anchor positioning, balanced text, and scroll-driven animations. But he’s got his own new wishes and has done the leg-work to properly propose them, like more useful vertical alignment (without extra work ). Christopher Kirk-Nielsen also has some wishes for better support for thing that ought to be doing that naturally, like Style Queries, but also has some really interesting ideas of his own like using transform to force an element of an unknown size into a specific size, which he also wrote up properly . Manuel Matuzović has more love for Style (and State ) Queries (agreed there is some real potential here to reduce CSS size and complexity) and @scope. On the doesn’t-exist-yet side, a vote for mixins to which I’ll echo: Yes, please! Elly Loel weighted in last year using the same distinctions: stuff that is already cooking (e.g. Custom Media) and stuff that doesn’t exist yet (e.g. detecting flex-wrap ). Good news for Elly, some stuff from the list got done, like subgrid. Nathan Knowler joins the choir with strong votes for Style Queries, Scroll-Driven Animations, and @scope, among others. Sarah Gebauer has a great one on her wishlist about borders and controlling the offset. Hey, SVG can do it and it’s super cool. Plus a shout out to a personal favorite: more useful attributes and the attr() function. Phew! That’s a lot of people taking the time to be pumped about CSS and make clear what they want. The way CSS is going lately I would not be surprised to see massive progress again in 2024. Stephanie Eckles points out 12 one-liners in CSS that are all tremendously useful and powerful. One liners. Stuff like p { text-wrap: pretty; } that just makes web type all the nicer. Five years ago our gaping mouths would have been on the floor if they knew what was coming. Brecht De Ruyte took two brand new CSS and HTML things and smashed them together: The new <selectmenu> element, which is exactly like <select> except fully CSS styleable. The Anchor Position API It’s a cool interaction. But this was actually published mid-last-year, and the demo is already broken even. It only ever worked in Chrome Canary with the Experimental Web Platform Features flag turned on, so that just goes to show you how fast this experimental stuff moves. It’s not <selectmenu> any more, it’s <selectlist> , but even after forking the demo and trying to fix it, I couldn’t get it. I suspect it’s changes to the Anchor Positioning API that I’m not up to snuff on. I do suspect this interaction is possible today, but you’d either be using cutting edge APIs that may or may not be polyfillable, and/or recreating a ton of interaction and accessibility stuff that you’d get for free with Brecht’s implementation. Ben Frain has a very clever idea for drawing angled lines in CSS (like a line chart). Which, weirdly, isn’t a particularly easy thing to do in CSS. You can make lines various ways and rotate them and stuff, but it’s harder to be like: draw a line from here to here. SVG is typically the path for that. In Ben’s technique, you take advantage of the polygon() function and clip-path . You “draw” points in the clip path at certain coordinates, then go back over the exact same coordinates with a 1px difference, leaving that little gap where a new color can “shine through”. Like: clip-path: polygon(
0% 60%,
20% 90%,
40% 43.33%,
60% 61.67%,
80% 23.33%,
100% 18.33%,
100% calc(18.33% - 1px),
80% calc(23.33% - 1px),

40% calc(43.33% - 1px),

What does the Tier-Dott merge say about survival?
E-scooter startups Tier and Dott are uniting forces. Inevitably, together, the merger will become a dominant force in European micro-mobility. Because of the context and the needs in common for these two companies, it’s a move that smells like survival spirit. 🛴
Acting separately, they were not going to reach IPO scale, so…Think on Avengers or Justice League; it’s the same thing: joining superpowers in hard times. (Thanos doesn’t like this.)
In the case of this loving couple joining forces (  ) , it will unlock new markets, harness economies of scale, and expand the portfolio. (E-bikes come as part of the formula. 🚲)
Taking this case as an example of what a merger needs, let’s think of some characteristics required for survival in every business:
✅ Shared values and objectives.
✅ Market dominance.
✅ Collaborative synergy.
The year is still too young, but let’s wait for more weddings shortly. 🔔

LatAm is the New Frontier for Startup Expansion
Many startups are increasingly eyeing Latin American markets for expansion (  ) , with Poland and Romania joining Spain and Portugal in the exploration. Fintech startup Payflow, for example, has seen a third of its business come from Latin America since its expansion there.
However, the region has challenges. Recruiting experienced leaders reasonably cheaply proves difficult, and navigating local governmental requirements can be tricky. Despite this, investors claim countries like Chile are making it easier for foreign startups to establish a presence.

From Adam Argyle. pen Bouncy Image Radio Group Click the images in this gallery to see them bounce gently, then settle in naturally thanks to some slick CSS work with :has() and eased transitions from Temani Afif. Chris’ Corner A collection of web design and development news and thoughts from CodePen's own Chris Coyier. The “switch” is a pretty common design pattern on the web. It’s pretty much a checkbox. In fact, under the HTML hood, it really ought to be an <input type=""checkbox""> or perhaps a <select> with just two <option> s (or a third if there is an indeterminate state). But unfortunately, the web doesn’t give us any primitive that looks particularly switch-like, as in, some kind of knob that is flipped one way or the other. So we use CSS. For example, we hide the checkbox one way or another, making sure there is still a discoverable clickable area, then with the :checked selector, style something that looks switch-like. Here’s a very classic example . Marcus Burnette nicely re-creating the iOS toggle look I’m sure you could imagine using that for, say, toggling email notification settings on an off for some sort of app. We use them here on CodePen quite a bit, for stuff like toggling the privacy of a Pen. Or you might use a toggle to switch a site between dark mode and light mode. Speaking of that, Aleksandr Hovhannisyan has a solid article about the struggles of a dark mode toggle. You’d think it would be pretty straightforward, but it really isn’t. Consider that users have system-level preferences in addition to your site-level preference, and you have to honor them in the proper order. Plus you have to set the controls properly as well as actually style the site accordingly, ideally without temporarily flashing the wrong colors. ( FART ). Aleksandr does a good job of it and links to other posts that have done a similarly good job. It’s always way more code than you want it to be, leading me to think browsers and standards could and should get more involved, but I also admit I don’t have a perfect idea on what they should do. Chrome has played with Auto Dark Mode , but it’s not clear how that trial went. (And speaking of Dark Mode, this gallery is pretty nicely done.) Anyway, I was trying to talk about switches! I saw Jen Simmons note that Safari is playing with a native switch. Here’s the HTML: <input type=""checkbox"" switch /> Nice. And here’s what it looks like by default: No big surprise there! It’s the native iOS toggle come to life. It respects accent-color in CSS like other form controls, which is great. But better, it has really sensible pseudo elements you can grab and style. You get ::thumb and ::track elements (nice clear naming) plus ::before and ::after work on the element itself, so there are a lot of possibilities. .custom-switch {
}
.custom-switch::thumb {
}
.custom-switch::track {
}
.custom-switch:checked::thumb {
}
.custom-switch:checked::track {
}
.custom-switch::checked::after {

.custom-switch::checked::before {"

</fit-vids> If the JavaScript doesn’t load, all good, video is still there. More, if somehow, say via a fetch request or the like, more videos get injected onto the page, there is no need to re-call any JavaScript to make these work. The way connectedCallback works they’ll just do their thing automatically when they arrive in the DOM. I’ll say I’m a fan of the “Light DOM Only” approach to Web Components . But there are some relatively big things you give up when you don’t use the Shadow DOM. Namely: slots. Slots is a pretty sweet mechanism for taking the “guts” HTML of a Web Component and slotting it properly into a likely-more-complicated bit of template HTML. This means that your fallback HTML can be simpler and possibly more appropriate. Cory LaViska explains it well , here’s some usage : <my-button>
Click me
<img slot=""icon"" src=""..."" alt=""..."" />
</my-button> Which gets smushed with: <template>
#shadow-root
<button type=""button"">
<span class=""icon"">
<slot name=""icon""></slot>
</span>
<span class=""label"">
<slot></slot>
</span>
</button>
</template> You can imagine how the <img> there makes it into the <slot> with a matching name. And then rest of the content goes into the default slot. Cory’s article is actually about extending this concept and building out HTML with as many slots as you need, as powered by attributes. It’s clever go read it . Speaking of parameters, that’s an approach that some web components take. Rather than any guts HTML at all, you say what you want of the component via attributes on the element. That’s a rather JavaScript-framework-y way of doing things. An example of this is <lite-youtube> which you use entirely with attributes: <lite-youtube

Distil-Whisper is a distilled variant of the Whisper model by OpenAI proposed in the paper ""Robust Knowledge Distillation via Large-Scale Pseudo Labelling."" Compared to Whisper, Distil-Whisper runs 6x faster with 50% fewer parameters, while performing to within a 1% word error rate (WER) on out-of-distribution evaluation data.
Find out how to run Distil-Whisper using OpenVINO™ and the pre-trained model from the Hugging Face Transformers library. To simplify the user experience, the Hugging Face Optimum library is used to convert the model to OpenVINO IR format. To further improve OpenVINO Distil-Whisper model performance, INT8 post-training quantization from NNCF is applied.

Question: What is the set of strings over the alphabet {a, b, c} containing at least one a and at least 1 b?
Answer from Brian Peterson
It’s not clear what to make of this question. The only other question posed by this poser didn’t make any real sense, asking whether the sine function is an injective sequ

Question: What is the regular expression for the set of strings containing at least one of each letter in the alphabet {x, y, z}?

I’d use lookaheads. “If we start here and look forward, there should be something (or maybe nothing) and then x.” Same again for y. Same again for z. And then “Oh, yeah, a

Question: What is the regular expression for the language: strings of ‘a’ and ‘b’containing at least two “b”?
Answer from Hugo Kotsubo
You could use:

Question: What is the set of strings over the alphabet {a, b, c} containing at least one b and at least 1 c?
Answer from Ian Joyner
This is an infinitely large set. The smallest strings are ‘bc’ and ‘cb’. All other strings are constrained in that they must contain one of those substrings.

The mechanical but tedious approach would be:

2. Convert the NDFA to a DFA. For example by using the powerset constructi

"CSS Coincidences, GSAP Lunch, and Abstract Animation","View this issue on CodePen CSS Coincidences, GSAP Lunch, and Abstract Animation This week's CodePen community highlights include a comiCSS coincidence from Alvaro Montoro, a delicious lunchtime with GSAP's ScrollTrigger from Tom Miller, and a beautiful abstract animation of a nighttime drive from wheatup. Plus, Nicolas Jesenberger brings the holiday cheer with a jaunty Santa hat, and Sebastian Schepis takes us into the mysterious world of Tripoles. pen Drive Home (CSS) wheatup evokes the feeling of a moody night time drive with a minimal bokeh dot animation in CSS. Inspired by a GLSL shader from The Art of Code. pen Santa Hat Button It's that time of year! Nicolas Jesenberger brings some Christmas cheer to a button with a little snow shower and a jaunty Santa hat. collection #CodePenChallenge: Gradient Glow We wrapped up the November ""Style Trends"" challenge with a gradient glow! Check out our collection from week 4, including Pens by Mona Plamondon , Ryan Jagdfeld , Mads Stoumann , and Ismail Vittal . pen Grid Loader (React) Multi-colored dots slide in and out of view with a satisfying, subtle squish in this lovely loader from animation master Chris Gannon. pen Tripoles ""Tripoles are digital constructs made of energy and entropy. The Tripoles seen here are constructs made of component objects with the same name - tripoles have the same capabilities all active observers possess - the ability to sense energy, and the ability to mediate it into an action. Turns out all that is needed for enless complexity to arise are the simplest of actions - observation, mediation, actuation. Observers aren't just an emergent afterthought - observation is a fundamental creative force in the Universe."" From Sebastian Schepis. pen 25 Seconds of Confetti The Brutal Tooth expands on a tsParticles.js demo from Matteo Bruni to bring us 25 solid seconds of continuous confetti in this playful Pen. pen Möbius Strip - CSS Josetxu demonstrates some serious clip-path and gradient chops in this CSS rendition of an  infinite mathematical object, the Möbius strip . sponsor Embeddable Data Importer for Businesses Flatfile makes importing clean & validated customer data fast & easy. Collect data— CSV, XLSX or more—via SDK, API, webhooks, or workflows. Leverage AI to transform & match fields that meet your specific format. Revolutionize your business’s import solution today, it's free! pen Abaclock Mark Boots mixes ancient tech with modern JavaScript & CSS to produce an abacus that tells time! sponsor Multiplayer servers for all your gaming needs Power up your gaming world with an IONOS Dedicated Gaming Server! Take the reins of player interactions, set your game's rules, and tailor the server for epic gaming sessions. With full root access, mold your IaaS to perfectly fit your project's pulse. Game on, your way! pen Just about time for lunch... Tom Miller adds some ""GSAP ScrollTrigger magic to this handsome photo by Pablo Merchan "" in this luscious luncheon of a Pen. pen comiCSS: Coincidence? Alvaro Montoro recreates the JavaScript ""correlation vs. causation"" meme with CSS in this thought provoking Pen 🤔 Chris’ Corner A collection of web design and development news and thoughts from CodePen's own Chris Coyier. Josh Comeau has a new learning guide out for CSS grid: An Interactive Guide to CSS Grid . I like how Josh gets into the “mental model” right away, because that’s the biggest thing with big APIs like this: you need to get the basics of how it works in your head so you know when and why to reach for it. The niche details are less important. You can look them up. Mostly you need to understand that the thing exists and what it is capable of. Ideally you can write a basic setup from memory. Then the more niche stuff you reference. Josh’s guide, especially with the interactivity, loads you up with that mental model. Josh has done the same before with an An Interactive Guide to Flexbox . The interactive bit goes a long way in locking in that mental model. In my CSS-Tricks days, our guide to flexbox was also decent at explaining the model I think, and also was a decent reference guide at the same time. But it didn’t have that interactivity so people were left to extracting the information to their own code to play. Once people are writing their own layout code, I’d wager that’s also a pretty big moment for locking in a mental model. CodePen editable embeds might be a good way to bring that to guides like this. I know that a very lot of people had their ah-ha moment with flexbox via Flexbox Froggy , and I think it’s that combination of interactivity and real code that made that so effective. Speaking of Cool Josh Ideas, have you seen his operator lookup page ? JavaScript has a pretty decent number of operators, and some of them you really have to look up to remember sometimes: Sometimes my brain goes… what’s the one where you set the value, but if the value is null, provide a fallback . Which is this one . Do you know about import maps yet? They aren’t some new niche thing, they are supported across the board . (Well, a little new, maybe). I like Yoshi Huang’s article(s) on them, they do a good job of setting the stage. My brain goes a little like this. This is really common code to see, but it’s actually invalid JavaScript: import lodash from ""lodash""; If you see code like that, traditionally , it means that the JavaScript will be going through a processor of some sort that is going to resolve ""lodash"" to some actual location where that code can be found. If we wanted that code to be valid JavaScript, we’d either have to: Import from a relative file path (e.g. that string has got to start with a dot or a slash) Import from a URL The latter being like: import lodash from ' But now, the original import statement actually is valid. That is, as long as we use an import map. From Yoshi’s article, something like: <script type=""importmap"">
{
""imports"": {
""lodash"": ""/node_modules/lodash-es/lodash.js""
}
}"

Chris’ Corner A collection of web design and development news and thoughts from CodePen's own Chris Coyier. I’m a sucker for a new coding font. I generally don’t think what coding font you use affects productivity in any significant way (unless it’s distracting) so farting around and switching it up is just a fun little thing to do. Like pushing around the furniture in your room or taking a different bike route to work. So count me in for playing with GitHub’s new set of monospace coding fonts: Monaspace . (Before I get too far without mentioning it, you can use them on CodePen just by visiting your editor settings and picking one.) The fact that there is five different stylized versions alone is pretty note worthy, but there are a variety of other features that are pretty darn cool. Texture Healing feels like a made up term, but what it does is pretty easy to understand and clearly useful. It basically makes it so wide letters don’t have to scrunch themselves and narrow letters don’t have to exaggerate themselves. They say: Texture healing works by finding each pair of adjacent characters where one wants more space, and one has too much. Narrow characters are swapped for ones that cede some of their whitespace, and wider characters are swapped for ones that extend to the very edge of their box. Which is done with the OpenType feature “contextual alternates”. It’s a little bit like a ligature, where certain character combinations flop out into a new glyph that works best with them together, only, ya know, slightly different. Monaspace has ligatures too. Ligatures are pretty controversial in coding fonts. For instance some people really hate that != might turn into ≠ as a ligature as that is like a deviation from the literal syntax of the language you may be writing. They aren’t my favorite but it’s not a firmly held opinion and it’s easy enough just to not use them. (They aren’t enabled on CodePen, as it seems like it might be confusing for some beginners.) They come as a variable font, which I love because variable fonts rule. And it’s not a phoned in variable font with one measly axis, it’s weight, and width, and slant, which is wonderful. The download comes both with variable and non-variable versions. If you don’t plan to use the variable-ness, the variable fonts are an order of magnitude larger so probably use the non-variable versions. If it’s not on the web it probably doesn’t matter. Also curious they only shipped .woff and not .woff2 ? My very favorite idea they have around this “superfamily” is the idea of mixing and matching them for different reasons in the same UI. The idea of having an italic monospace is starting to be more and more common. Gotta shout out the OG Operator for breaking that ground. Setting comments in italics is still just a super cool idea to me. Now we could use Radon for that, a different typeface entirely designed for it. In the image above, they suggest JSDoc-style comments using Xenon and GitHub CoPilot using Krypton. I love it. Ship it. (But I don’t think it’s possible in VS Code yet, but considering Microsoft makes both, you’d think it’s coming.) To make that possible, essentially, you need syntax highlighting tools to provide tokens/classes that make it easy to identify different aspects of code. It’s certainly possible, and probably not even that hard, but it’s probably a somewhat tricky thing to roll out with so many third-party themes out there. But anyway, how great is this? If you’re into playing with different coding fonts, well make sure to explore the fact that we have over 20 of them on CodePen to switch between. But of course there are far more than that out in the wild. A great read about the landscape of “playful and fun” coding fonts is Doug Wilson’s Coding with Character . Doug dug (ha) up this great example of IBM “SELECTRIC” TYPE SAMPLES (literally different typewriter fonts you could swap between by replacing a metal ball in the typewriter): So cool! I love that this new wave of coding fonts is kind of a callback to what was happening here, whether everyone recognizes it or not. The first one Doug mentions is Operator which I used for years and years after it came out and still love. The second is Comic Code: My first thought: This has to be a joke, right?! Comic Sans has a bad reputation and was never meant to be used for coding—but what if…? That is what crazy mastermind Toshi Omagari seemed to ask. He says, “ Comic Code is a monospaced adaptation of the most over-hated typeface.” I haven’t asked, but I feel his thought process may have been something like this GIF . Believe it or not, I think it actually works and certainly brings a smile—or at least a smirk—to your face Totally agree! It works! While I was in our code base putting in the Monaspace fonts, of course I couldn’t resist doing general code cleanup. The Monaspace fonts only ship in .woff, so the @font-face in CSS is pretty much as simple as: @font-face {
font-family: 'Font Name';
src: url('./fonts/font.woff') format('woff');
} You can get away with only shipping in woff2 these days, so some of our fonts that have that format, that’s exactly what I’m doing. The simplicity there just feels great since this used to be such a complex bit of code in the past with loads of formats. Then I recently learned from an Ollie Williams blog post that you don’t have to put the format as a string anymore, keywords work, so: @font-face {
font-family: 'Font Name';
src: url('./fonts/font.woff2') format(woff2);"

Backend Courses on Frontend Masters,"We have a full backend learning path, and a new Enterprise DevOps course with Erik Reinert!
Hi Ambarish,
We started by teaching front-end engineering skills, but developers asked us to teach more topics as our courses and teaching style gained popularity. Despite our name, ""Frontend Masters,"" folks asked for databases, servers, command line, VIM, API Design, docker, and more!
We eventually taught so many backend topics that we created an entire backend / fullstack learning path (  ) ! →  (  )
Will you go into backend courses? (  )
And now we go even deeper into DevOps!
Enterprise Cloud Infrastructure (  )
Engineers rely on source control and automation to work more efficiently, simplify complex operations, and reduce points of failure. Can this same approach apply to DevOps infrastructure? It can, and Erik Reinert will show you how to do it in his new course on automating enterprise infrastructure with Terraform Cloud.
Erik Reinert teaching his new Cloud Infrastructure course (  )
Applying GitOps to DevOps infrastructure makes GitHub your source of truth. It also gives you infrastructure as code — which is much easier to manage than the AWS or Google Cloud UIs. Need to deploy a new cluster on a network? Submit a PR to the repo. Did you accidentally specify the wrong instance or market type for the cluster? Revert to the previous commit. Terraform monitors your workspace repositories and takes care of the automation for you.
Automating AWS infrastructure with code (  )
In this course, you will also
* Understand the advantages and disadvantages of self-hosted vs. cloud providers
* Use Doppler to manage and share environment variables
* Automate the creation of service repositories
* Deploy AWS network resources using GitOps
* Gain foundational knowledge of enterprise cloud infrastructure
Grab a membership today (  ) , and we hope you enjoy this new course on Enterprise Cloud Infrastructure (  ) !

CEO & UI Developer

P.S. We also released a new episode of the podcast (  ) with Erik's journey from tech support agent to front-end engineer, all the way to Dev Ops:

"Light your lantern, Diwali is here","(  )
Hi udgirkarambarish ,
"" Our house was alive with the smell of sugar and ghee, as our mom prepared for weeks with feasts of treats. She boxed them into neat plastic containers and my sister and I would embark from house to house, handing out our mom's famous Deepavali sweets…. ""
That's a Deepavali memory offered by writer Anarghya Vardhana (  ) , whose essay details her childhood experience (  ) of the popular Indian holiday also known as Diwali. Millions around the world celebrate this age-old festival of lights, which spotlights several spiritual and literal triumphs for Hindus, Jains and Sikhs: knowledge over ignorance, good over evil and light over all.
The preparations take weeks. There's the deep cleaning and decluttering of your house plus the release of old habits, grudges and limiting beliefs that weigh a person down in their new year. There are family rituals of adding turmeric or yellow paint to the door frame— to keep in the good and keep out the bad. There are stories told of the Goddess Lakshmi and charitable steps made to end global poverty and welcome wealth — irrespective of caste and creed. There are feasts, gifts, lamps, fireworks, dancing, worship and joy.
As the poet Fatima Imam, Ph.D (  ). writes:
A festival of lights.
A festival of joy.
A festival of good luck.
A festival of compassion.
Deepavali is this and more to the millions who celebrate across every continent, and Medium is proud to support those stories.

Xbox is improving our data collection processes around accounts for children. |
View as Webpage
Microsoft’s Xbox Parental Controls and Family
Settings
Xbox is improving our data collection processes around accounts for children. On 05 June 2023, we entered into a settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to resolve allegations that our previous account creation process for Xbox Live improperly collected information from children without properly notifying and getting permission from their parents. As part of the settlement, we’re writing to let you know about privacy settings to protect children playing on your Xbox.
Create a child account
If there is a child that plays on your adult Xbox account, please create a child account for them.
GET STARTED   ❯
Regularly check privacy settings
A child Xbox account has privacy settings that protect children. For example, a child Xbox account by default only lets children communicate with friends that you approve; and limits how Microsoft shares the child’s personal information with others.
Xbox
family safety settings give you more privacy options to choose from. To review your settings, go to your
Privacy Dashboard, then click on the Xbox icon to get to your
Privacy and online safety settings.
Now, and in the future, you can see the personal information we collect from children linked to your account. Sign in to your account on your
Privacy Dashboard and select your child's account in the drop-down to review and clear data.
Additionally, you can ask us to delete the account by submitting a request through our
account closure form. Please be sure to sign in with your child’s account credentials.
To manage consent for a child, go to your
Microsoft family safety dashboard. Sign in to your account, click the three dots next to your child’s name, then “manage consent”.
Committed to protecting children
To learn about what data we collect and how we use it, read the
Microsoft Privacy Statement.
The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act gives you control over the information companies collect from your children under 13. To learn more, read the Federal Trade Commission’s
Protecting Your Child’s Privacy Online and
Xbox’s online safety and privacy settings.
We’re here for you
If you have questions or concerns about your child’s privacy or would like to contact us, please visit us
here.

Chris’ Corner A collection of web design and development news and thoughts from CodePen's own Chris Coyier. If you ever need some inspiration for buttons, definitely check out Lucas Bonomi’s buttons.cool . This is a better-than-it-needs-to-be one-off site just for beautiful buttons: But it’s not just a design gallery, it’s made for front-end developers in that you can see the code, see them being live-rendered right on the page, and of course, the best part is you can pop right over to CodePen for a look. Looks like it’s taking submissions . How hard is a Dark Mode to pull off? Or perhaps more accurately, how hard is it to pull off a second color mode? Some of us have dark-mode-first websites, ya know . I thought Wes Bos phrased the question well : Question for those who have implemented light/dark mode: how much is just swapping out variables, and how much is custom code, and tending to edge cases? I answered: fiddy fiddy. In the new version of CodePen we’re working on, we will have a site-wide theme setting (which is separated from what syntax highlighting theme you choose). CodePen being a pretty complex site, it involved quite a bit of CSS custom property setting. So in a sense, it was mostly just “swapping out variables”, but quite a few of those variables exist just because of different color modes, most of which I might even call an “edge case”. For us: north of 100 south of 200. I found this to be challenging but ultimately a fair approach. Sometimes you see ideas going around of how simple it could be. For instance, he’s Akhil Arjun saying it can be done in one line : html[theme='dark-mode'] {
filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg);
} And here’s Mads Stoumann with a totally different 3-line approach: body {
background-color: Canvas;
color: CanvasText;
color-scheme: light dark;
} While I appreciate a good CSS trick and these are good things to know about, I’m going to go ahead and say these super minimal approaches probably aren’t going to get you very far. You’re going to want better control than this and you’re going to need to deal with those edge cases. Now that we have such powerful layout tools in CSS (keep ’em coming, CSS!) — it’s fun to see little layout situations that look fairly simple but are still a little challenging. Tyler Sticka ran across one he calls Tricky Floating Image Alignment . The idea is to have some text that is center aligned with an image, but if the text grows larger than the image, use the behavior of float . I liked the solution in the end. It’s a throwback to the way we used to be able to vertically center stuff with top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%) . This will do the centering nicely, but when the text is bigger than the container, they essentially cancel out and so essentially do nothing. Here’s another tricky layout situation, this time involving newfangled HTML and CSS features, namely anchor positioning. (Think of it as positioning an element based on another arbitrary element’s position.) Eric Meyer blogged it as Nuclear Anchored Sidenotes . Imagine a footnote, except on a large enough screen, it’s more like a sidenote. That is, the note goes into empty sidebar space at the exact line that the footnote marker appears on. But to really pull this off, you’re using anchor positions of multiple elements: Yes, I’m anchoring the sidenotes with respect to two completely different anchors, one of which is a descendant of the other.  That’s okay!  You can do that! I did not know you could do that, but I like it. top: anchor(top); /_ implicit anchor _/"

Sign up to access the latest Intel HW & SW technologies,""""" Sign Up for the New Intel® Developer Cloud
It’s surely no secret.
Developing AI & HPC applications and solutions not only is necessary in today’s environment, it’s also insanely challenging—reliant on accessing high-performance hardware (which is expensive at best, unavailable at worst) and having the right mix of OS’s and development tools at your fingertips.
This can put the brakes on innovation and competitiveness.
A development environment purpose-built for optimizing AI and HPC applications and workloads, Intel Developer Cloud provides access to the latest Intel® hardware and software technologies, so you can build, test, and optimize you code faster, cost-effectively, and efficiently.
Choose your service tier and sign up"""" Here’s a snapshot of what you could have access to when you get an account:

*           Run small- and large-scale AI training, model optimization, and inference workloads such as Meta AI Llama 2, Databricks Dolly, and more
*           Utilize small to large VMs or bare-metal systems

Dear Ambarish,
Unleash IoT with Intelligent Edge Devices
Edge computing places devices, gateways, and compute as close as possible to the source of data—and to the systems and people who need to make data-driven decisions. Think vision-guided robots, intelligent driver assistance in commercial vehicles, or even patient monitoring in critical care.
Explore some real-world examples of how Intel customers have harnessed the power of edge computing to unlock potent business benefits.

Dear Ambarish,
Step into the Industry 4.0 Era
Industrial IoT (IIoT) delivers more than just real-time visibility across your manufacturing processes. It collects valuable data that can be drilled for actionable insights and serves as the stepping stone to edge intelligence and advanced automation. Think predictive maintenance, enhanced worker safety, supply chain automation and other exciting possibilities. Find out how you can reimagine the factory with IIoT.
Discover IIoT with Intel"""" Simplify AI Deployment
At Intel, we believe that empowering developers is the key to driving forward technology innovation. This is especially true when it comes to deep learning applications, which can be complex and cumbersome to develop and deploy.
Now, Intel and Microsoft have joined hands to offer developers the flexibility of choice among deep learning frameworks and deployment environments. In this way, we are bridging the gap between deploying cloud-developed AI solutions to edge devices. Keen to know more?
Other names and brands may be claimed as the property of others."

"CSS Sci-Fi, Baldur's Gate Buttons, and Divtober Begins","View this issue on CodePen CSS Sci-Fi, Baldur's Gate Buttons, and Divtober Begins This week's CodePen community highlights include a portal into a CSS spaceship from Josetxu, a trio of Baldur's Gate 3-inspired buttons from Aaron Iker, Jane Ori, and Nicolas Jesenberger, and the return of Lynn Fisher's legendary annual single-div CSS illustration challenge Divtober ! Plus, Ben Evans brews up a spectacular pot of CSS coffee, and Jon Kantner brings a new -tober to the table: Clocktober ⏰ pen Pure CSS Moka Pot Ben Evans serves up a terrific pot of CSS coffee with just a dash of HTML — and once again, no JavaScript at all! Hover around the scene to see all the angles, and check out the making of video on YouTube . pen Spacecraft SCI-FI Door - Pure CSS ""First test of what I hope will be a series of 3D sci-fi spacecraft doors made in pure CSS.

Easily run builds with Kubes Benefit from managed configurations and updates, allowing your team to focus on developing — on secure and scalable infrastructure. pen Skyline Checkboxes Turn the lights on and off in skyscraper windows in this playful Pen showcasing the checkbox hack from Mads Stoumann. pen #Clocktober Day 7: Layered Jon Kantner's a master of intricate UI details, and this month he's turned his attention to front-end clockmaking. This 3D layered Pen is the 7th in a monthlong series. Follow Jon to keep time in your following feed. Chris’ Corner A collection of web design and development news and thoughts from CodePen's own Chris Coyier. You’ve seen CSS’ new :has() selector right? There are all these “basic” use cases that leave me smiling because the solutions of the past were inelegant at best, and now are easy and satisfying. Here’s one: You want margin below your <h2> … unless there is a <time> right below it, then no margin … but put the margin below the <time> instead. One approach to this with :has() is just a few lines and reads very clearly to me: h2 {
margin-block-end: 1.2rem;
&:has(+ time) {
margin-block-end: 0;
}
&:has(+ time) + time {
margin-block-end: 1.2rem;
}
} Demo But as I mentioned, that’s a “basic” use case. The power of :has() is very deep, as it allows for inspection from any DOM element down the tree, then moving as far back up as needed. It’s a bit hard to wrap my mind around that sometimes. Like Jim Neilsen said : I feel like lots of people have their own little oh yeah! moments with this CSS feature. Michelle Barker blogged a few of them , including an interesting combination with the :target selector. Does a certain “have” an element that is targetted? Yes? Animate the grid to reveal an otherwise hidden area: Poking around my own code bases, I can see it starting to sprinkle in. It’s interesting to see when it comes to unknown data coming into templates. Here’s a JSX example: <div class=""things"">
{things.map(thing => {
return(
<div class=""thing"" key={thing.id}>
<th data-category={thing.category}>{thing.name}</h3>
{thing.text}
</div>
);
})
</div> Here I’ve spat out a totally arbitrary list of “things”. I found it most useful to have the data-category attribute on the header, as direct styling with that was useful. But what if the parent needs styling based on that? Easy: .thing:has([data-category=""widget""]) {
background: yellow;
} More, what if the entire group needs a special style? And if it does, make all the headers smaller? .things:has([data-category=""widget""]) h3 {
font-size: 80%;
} Go down, then back up! I’m even very-mindblown-y on the idea that quantity queries are now easy. Does this list have at least 11 items in it? Yes? Then do something: ol:has(li:nth-child(11)) {
color: red;"

See also, Jhey Tompkins' variation on the same concept . Chris’ Corner A collection of web design and development news and thoughts from CodePen's own Chris Coyier. Chrome 117 went stable this past week. There is a website where you can see what the plan is for Chrome releases, by the way, which is handy when you care about such things. Chrome releases a major version about once a month, and I usually don’t feel ultra compelled to write anything about it specifically. Rachel Andrew does a great job covering web platform updates each month on Web.dev, like this past New to the web platform in August . I’m extra excited about this one, though, because it means subgrid has now shipped across all three major browsers. Chrome was the straggler here: Firefox shipped subgrid on Dec 2, 2019. Safari shipped subgrid on Sep 11, 2022. Chrome shipped subgrid on Sep 12, 2023. Caniuse is a great site for not only checking support but also seeing when versions shipped that have support. Lest I type too many words without explaining what subgrid is… it’s a keyword that works with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows that allow you to suck in the grid lines that pass through the element from the parent grid. .parent {
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
}
.child {
grid-column: 2 / 4;
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: subgrid;
} Does your browser support it? Probably, but it’s still good to check and to code around that check. Bramus has a Pen that’s a quicky check. The CSS feature @supports is up for the job: output::after {
content: ""❌ Your browser does not support subgrid"";
}
@supports(grid-template-rows: subgrid) {
output::after {
content: ""✅ Your browser supports subgrid"";
}"

"View Transitions, Stylish Shadows, and a Pixelated Waterfall","View this issue on CodePen View Transitions, Stylish Shadows, and a Pixelated Waterfall This week's CodePen community highlights includes a big dose of the view transitions API: a bookmark app UI from Aysenur Turk, and a tremendous guide to the in-and-outs of the API from Mojtaba Seyedi. Plus, Temani Afif and Adam Argyle share stylish image shadows, and Kit Jenson sends a barrel down a pixelated waterfall (that has a secret!) pen Merging Letter Toggle ""A toggle switch combined with FF or N to spell “OFF” or “ON”, and the letters merge or split depending on the state."" From Jon Kantner. pen Bookmark App - View Transitions Aysenur Turk translates a Dribbble shot by Dwinawan to SCSS & JS, and demonstrates the panache of the view transitions API in this irresistibly clickable Pen. pen (Svelte) Range Slider Simon Goellner adds ""fancy, bouncy, floating labels"" that wave as you drag the pips along the range slider in this interactive Pen,
inspired by a Dribble shot by Antonin Kus . pen GSAP Mask Mouse Effect alig01 reveals a hidden truth of the internet with a slick spotlight effect in this GSAP-powered Pen. link What is the View Transitions API? Mojtaba Seyedi wrote a comprehensive guide to the power of the View Transitions API, complete with lots of linked & embedded Pens so you can jump right in and try it yourself. pen Infinite Image Shadow In Temani Afif's Pen, photos cast colorful shadows that stretch onnnnnnnn and on forever — in both square and rounded corner varieties. collection #CodePenChallenge: Pagination September's challenge is all about navigation, and we started with pagination. Page through our collection from week one, including Pens by Grass , Pierre-Nicolas Picot , kotAndy , and Josetxu . sponsor Master Composable Web Architectures Dive into O'Reilly's new report by Stefan Baumgartner, author of ""TypeScript in 50 Lessons,"" and explore frontend composability, serverless backends & modular design. Available for free, courtesy of Storyblok, the beloved CMS committed to providing resources that empower you. pen A ""real"" accordion [AUDIO WARNING] Depending on how you look at it, David Darnes either wrecks a perfectly good accordion menu, or makes a typical menu actually kinda fun in this playful Pen. sponsor How do I model a schema for my application? It's one of the most common questions developers have when starting with MongoDB Atlas. And the answer is, it depends. In this article, learn the basics of data modeling you can use when designing the database schema for your application. pen Waterfall & Barrel ""A pixel-based waterfall. No reason... thought it would be a fun challenge. Of course I couldn't leave it alone, so now there is a hidden cave and floating barrel. Why, you ask? I don't know honestly."" From Kit Jenson. pen highlight compliment to a text-shadow effect ""That 2px (almost) white highlight on the top of the text makes it seem as though there's a light source."" From Adam Argyle. Chris’ Corner A collection of web design and development news and thoughts from CodePen's own Chris Coyier. I think the nail is in coffin now : you should never design something for the web with only one (or even a narrow set) of particular viewport sizes in mind. It’s just so darn tempting to think that way. You have a couple of pretty specific screen sizes in front of you right now, you likely design toward those to some degree. Design tools often ask you to draw a rectangle that represent a screen to design for. Testing tools sometimes show you a site at a set of pre-set screen sizes. It can feel normal and fine to design toward, say, three sizes, and hone in on them. Honestly, that might end up working fine, but it might not! It might lead to some awkward in-betweens, especially if you are very rigid in writing CSS that only changes at those specific breakpoints only. That’s the thing, really. You just don’t have to think in really specific breakpoints anymore. Media query width breakpoints are still a fine tool, but now we’ve got viewport units, container units, container queries, calc/min/max/clamp, and all sorts of other stuff that allow you to design components and pages that work well and look good at the size and under the conditions they are in. It’s just a better way to code. But this stuff has only relatively recently arrived in CSS so it’ll take a minute for it all to settle in. This isn’t even really new news. Over a decade ago , I was like, yo, there are a ton of different sizes that your site is getting viewed at. Deal with it. Now we can properly. And now for something completely different Have websites gone to crap? Browse around popular sites, and I think you’ll land on an easy yes. Especially on mobile, cripes. Just to name a few: they are too slow to load, the ads and popups are too obtrusive, and there is too much usage of fixed-position elements that reduce usable area. This website User Inyerface satirized it recently, and it’s pretty funny (ya know, if being intentionally frustrated is your thing, gamers should relate). People have been worried about this for ages, and it never seems to get any better. Brad Frost called it BS . A couple folks made termsandconditions.game mining these patterns for ideas. Guangyi Li’s how-i-experience-web-today.com gets at the heart of the complete experience. Tracking is a big part of this story, and clickclickclick.click pokes at that. This all just makes me sad. Fortunately, most things are fine . And now for something completely different Have you seen the popover API ? It’s a neat idea, already play-with-able in Chrome. Think styled tooltips. The idea is that you connect some interaction (click of a button) to toggling another element with more information or context. Amazingly, to me, this HTML totally works in Chrome with no CSS or JavaScript at all: <button popovertarget=""my-popover"">Open Popover</button>
<div id=""my-popover"" popover>
<p>I am a popover with more information.</p>"

"Stretchy Type, CSS Timers, and Poisson Disk Sampling","a full screen video as a background at any screen size, with a combo of ""absolute positioning, full viewport width and height, and 'object-fit: cover;'"" Chris’ Corner A collection of web design and development news and thoughts from CodePen's own Chris Coyier. SVG has so many tricks up its sleeve. It’s really a full-featured drawing API literally designed for the web, but few of us really truly understand it nor reach for it enough. Heck, I even wrote a book about it , and I don’t. At the time, just getting people to use SVG for icons felt like an uphill battle, but thankfully, I think that one has been won. Let’s look at some cool SVG examples that have crossed my desk lately. Animate an SVG Shape’s Inner Stroke Christopher Kirk-Nielsen with a variety of demos that are a good reminder that stroke is animatable (like the width of it), which can do some cool effects. This demo looks like the classic one where the stroke moves to the inside only, filling the shapes. It was only in the last few years that browsers like Chrome GPU accelerated SVG animations , making stuff like this really smooth. SVG viewBox padding To be clear, the viewBox in SVG does not actually have padding. But it’s an important thing to think about. Chuan makes the point that if you make a 10✕10 area via the viewBox , then make a <rect> that fills that 10✕10 area, the stroke around it, the stroke will be half cut off. That’s because stroke straddles the edge of shapes in SVG. So you either gotta monkey with the coordinates of the shapes, or you gotta adjust the viewBox to handle it. Chuan’s thinking is: let a processor handle it. viewBox=""0 0 10 10 padding .5""
/_ translates to _/
viewBox=""-.5 -.5 11 11"" Clever thinking, really. The CSS Doodle tool can do it . So… you can set an SVG circle’s radius in CSS? The very basic answer to Paul Hebert’s questions is: yeah, totally. Like if you have this: <svg viewBox=""0 0 100 100"" xmlns=""
<circle cx=""50"" cy=""50"" r=""50"" />
</svg> You can adjust the radius in CSS like: circle {
r: 20;
} Not CSS you see every day, but yeah, that’s totally fine. But Paul’s point is that normally you set the radius in the SVG code, but you might need it in CSS code. Like, a way to keep them in sync is good. In Paul’s demo , it looks like he doesn’t even set the radius in SVG at all, just does it in CSS via a --radius Custom Property, then uses that in the other calculations needed to make these percentage meters work. Understanding SVG Paths The <path> element in SVG is the most complicated of the shape drawing elements. In fact, as I understand it, all the other elements are just syntactic sugar over a path anyway. I once wrote An Illustrated Guide when I was learning it and figuring it out. But Nanda Syahrasyad has outdone me easily in Understanding SVG Paths . The trick is understanding the commands. They are pretty understandable in the end, as it were. They are like “pick the pen up and move it here, then draw a line over to here” or “starting where you are, move the pen in this direction this far” or “draw a curve from here to there using these other two points as essentially gravitational poles.” If you get into it, you’ll find yourselves (gasp) drawing your own shapes. I love Nanda’s opener: I think you’re kind of a next-level front-end developer if you’re building bending ass buttons like that. SVGs have additional pointer-events properties If you’re like me, you think of pointer-events in CSS as a thing you use to set none once in a while. Maybe you set some colored overlay <div> over something, but you don’t want it to actually eat up clicks, so you set pointer-events: none on it and those clicks will slide right through. When it comes to SVG, though, Stefan Judis has noted some additional values for it that are specific to SVG like: .foo {
pointer-events: visiblePainted;"

Awesome News - August Edition,"Hey there.
As summer time comes to a close, we hope you and yours have enjoyed the sun without the burn. As for the Font Awesome crew, we’ve been chillin’ and grillin’ in our flip flops with the best of ‘em.
Even though we’re having fun in the sun, the icon forge is still running hot, as usual. Here’s a quick overview of what we’ve been up to.
PODCAST AWESOME — YOUR NEW BEACH POD BINGE!
We come at you every other week with short chats about icons, design, business, and nerdery with members of the Font Awesome team. Here’s what’s new to the airwaves.
* Hard Lessons in Business and Life [ — Listen to Dave Gandy share his experience of flunking out of MIT twice and how he turned his negative experiences into positives during the Font Awesome 5 Kickstarter.
* Appreciating the Virtuous Cycle of Nerdery [ — Nerd out and love what you do. In this podcast Mike Wilkerson talks about the importance of appreciating and caring for the project or product you're working on, as well as the tools you're using.
* Jory and Noah Discuss the History of FA-Icons [ — Gain insights into the process of icon design and development. Learn from FA's seasoned icon vets to sharpen your own design chops.
* Font Awesome Takes the Stage: A Recap of Config 2023 [ — We sit down with icon designers Jory Raphael and Noah Jacobus to discuss their experience at the Config conference. They share highlights from the event, including their own talk about drawing icons in Figma.
* Nerd Show and Tell: Meet Joey Hensen [ — According to Joey, there can be a lot of pressure in the finance world. Everyone works long hours in an effort to justify their existence in a world that's pretty stressful. Font Awesome, on the other hand, is not like that at all.
KEEP UP TO DATE ON THE LATEST FA-NEWS
* Introducing FA's CSS-Only Kits [ — Have you used Font Awesome Kits but got an unwanted jumpy effect on the screen? No bueno. But worry not, fellow developers! We’ve come up with a solution to tackle this challenge — CSS only Kits!
* Under the Hood: FA’s Scalability Overhaul [
* Introducing: Subsetting in FA Kits [ — Sometimes you want to take full control over what icons you and your team need. That’s why we’re introducing even more subsetting options to Font Awesome Kits.
Thanks for reading — and put on some sunscreen (your shoulders look pink)!
— Matt and the Fa-beach bums
P.S. Last fall, Shoelace [ joined the Font Awesome team. We’ve been hard at work on an all-new, super-secret project. Want to be the first one to find out the big news? Join the Shoelace Discord [

Get Practice Coding CSS Layouts,"Code three separate CSS layouts along with Jen Kramer from scratch: one easy, one medium, and one advanced!
Hi Ambarish,
What's the most critical part of making your CSS knowledge sink in? Practice!
In Jen Kramer's new course, Practical CSS Layouts (  ) , you'll get hands-on experience coding three separate CSS layouts from scratch: one easy, one medium, and one advanced.
Each layout comes with a set of responsive templates to show how they resize between mobile, tablet, and desktop:
Jen demonstrating a layout with mobile, tablet and desktop sizes (  )
Practical CSS Layouts (  )
Starting with the basics of CSS and HTML, you'll progress through creating responsive designs for mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts. You'll learn to code complex layouts with CSS Grid and Flexbox and tackle real-world exercises like styling buttons, audio players, hamburger menus, and lists. You'll explore concepts like rem and em units, custom fonts, responsive images, and the picture element. By the end of the course, you'll have built three variations of a website, each increasing in complexity!
Jen teaching her CSS Layouts course (  )
Here are some takeaways from the workshop:
* Create three variations of the same website - easy, medium, and advanced.
* Use semantic HTML markup to create interactive components like buttons, menus, lists, and skin an audio player.
* Make colors and font sizes configurable with custom properties.
* Get practice with CSS Grid and Flexbox to adapt to various screen sizes and devices.
* Move basic layouts to complex layouts with a handful of CSS properties.
Grab a membership today (  ) – and we hope you enjoy this new hands-on CSS course (  ) !

"Posters, Pointers, and Pulling to Refresh","View this issue on CodePen Posters, Pointers, and Pulling to Refresh What a great week of interesting work, thanks to you lovely folks in the CodePen community. There is some work inspired by print design, which always makes for interesting results, especially when there are interactive adaptations. New CSS is bustin' still, allowing for interactions that would have been hard or impossible before (see the pull to refresh stuff). Hyperplexed has a new one with his trademark ""let's break this complex effect down into smaller problems"" approach. And you know what, I think we'll all learn a little something about how coffee drinks are made this week. pen Interactive Art Poster — Homage to Gernes Each of the circles is an input of type=color, so you can click or tap them to open a color picker and change them. Open the full Pen to see a dark mode toggle as well. pen Magic Wand Reveal The latest Hyperplexed video is of this interactive wave-across effect that reveals images by moving them from not there at all to adjusting the opacity and blur to bring them in. There is loads of little details to get right though! pen OJaOQwz Dillon says: ""Another pen using Bridson's algorithm and Delaunay triangulation.
/* styles when :has() is supported */
} It is useful to think about what your plan is for detection, though. Like does it matter if Firefox doesn’t support :has() for what you are trying to do? Are you prepared to do it some other way if it’s not? As an example, I was talking to Eric Meyer the other day, and somehow table row/column highlighting came up, and he made a demo with :has() . Now you’d have to decide: how important is that effect? As written, in Firefox, just the cell you hover over highlights, so you could decide that’s fine, and then you don’t need any feature detection at all; you just let it fail. Alternatively, you could decide to use a @supports query in CSS and highlight the entire row if :has() isn’t supported, which is a similar effect (if not quite as cool). Another decision you could make is to do the test in JavaScript and use a JavaScript-powered fallback if necessary. Good news, Stephanie has a JavaScript testing tool just for this. It uses a number of different techniques to report if a feature is supported or not. Ultimately you could use it for our :has() test like: <script type=""module"">
import * as SupportsCSS from ""
const tests = [""has""];
SupportsCSS.init({ tests });
if (!SupportsCSSTests.results.has) {
document.head.insertAdjacentHTML(
""beforeend"",
""<style>tr:hover { background: rgba(255,0,0,0.33); }</style>""
);
}
</script> Ya know, just while we’re talking about feature detection in CSS, a typography-specific feature tester crossed my desk the other day, font-tech and font-format : @supports font-tech(palettes) {
.palette {
display: block;
}
}
@supports font-format(woff2) {
div {
display: block;
}
} Just interesting to me; I’ve never seen those specific functions before. Wait, wait, I gotta do one more about feature detection. There are some things that you cannot detect in CSS, and is kind of a pain in the butt to detect in JavaScript also. Ahmad Shadeed made this point in Do we need CSS flex-wrap detection? The point has been made again and again that we need certain state detections like a :stuck selector for position: sticky; elements, and it sounds likely we’ll get that . But “is wrapped or not” is another form of state, I’d say. Ahmad’s use case was like… if a line in a flexbox layout wraps, it’s saying: “there isn’t room for these on one line”. But where that is is totally arbitrary based on content and element size. But if we knew exactly when that break was, we could, for example, use that exact moment to break a line of navigation into a hamburger rather than guessing at some magic number size. Strong point, I think. I have an unnatural affinity for the “yellow fade technique”. It’s this idea that works with the :target selector in CSS and on-page anchor links. Imagine a table of contents where you click a link, and it jumps the page down (or scrolls, I suppose if you use scroll-behavior: smooth ). How do you know exactly where the page is trying to take you to and draw your attention toward? The element is probably at the top of the page, but it might not be if the page is too short. The yellow fade technique just makes it way more clear. When that jump happens, that element becomes the : target , and you apply a background-color animation to it (light yellow!) that draws attention to it. It’s just nice, I think. There are some classic examples on CodePen, naturally. The idea can also be applied to an element being added to the DOM, drawing attention to the fact that it just appeared. That’s what Bramus Van Damme does in The Yellow Fade Technique with Modern CSS using @starting-style . Erm… @starting-style , what’s that? It’s basically built for the yellow fade technique. 😍. div {
transition: background-color 0.5s;
background-color: transparent;
@starting-style {
background-color: yellow;
}
--bg: hsl(var(--hue) 50% 50%);
}
h1 {
--text: color-contrast(var(--bg) vs black, white);
color: var(--text);
background: hsl(0 0% 0% / 40%);
}
@supports (background: hsl(from red h s l)) {
h1 {
background: oklch(from color-contrast(var(--text) vs black,white) l c h / 40%);
}"

"[CodePen Spark] — Video Blend Modes, Retro Buttons, and Long Shadows","& div {
...
}
} Ends up as: :is(main, #intro) div { ... } Which makes it go from 0,0,1 for main div to 1,0,1 making it vastly more specific. I’m not sure if nesting gotchas is the ultimate example of CSS complexity gone wild, but it’s just one little potential poke. I remember in the Sass heyday that people would point to @extend as a complexity code smell and they weren’t wrong. Perhaps thanks to the scale and pervasiveness of npm, piles of questionable third-party code is another cause of complexity concern on the front-end. Michelle Barker gets into this in Reducing Complexity in Front End Development where she’s ruminating on Jack Franklin’s recent talk at All Day Hey. A quick look in our Node modules folder quickly exposes the web of complexity within, which few of us can really fathom. A single point of failure can bring down the entire stack, like the well-worn “house of cards” metaphor. Reducing dependencies, I’ll go out on a limb and say, is nearly always “worth it” in the sense of saving future-you headaches. Or as grug says: one day code base understandable and grug can get work done, everything good! next day impossible: complexity demon spirit has entered code and very dangerous situation! You can adjust your email preferences any time, or instantly opt out of emails of this kind.

The Hard Parts of UI Development – Will Sentance is back! 👨‍🏫,"Develop an under-the-hood knowledge of UI development.
Hi Ambarish,
Will Sentance's The Hard Parts of JavaScript (  ) course has been voted the ""most loved"" by members for many years due to his under-the-hood, visual explanations. The course gives you mental models of JavaScript's core concepts like callbacks and higher-order functions, closure, asynchronous JavaScript, and object-oriented JavaScript.
Florin Pop's twitter testimonial on JavaScript the Hard Parts (  )
Michal Wdowik's Twitter testimonial on JavaScript the Hard Parts (  )
Y'all loved this one so much that we recorded an entire ""Hard Parts"" series:
- JavaScript: The New Hard Parts (  ) – Asynchronous JavaScript, Promises, Iterators, and Generators
- The Hard Parts of Servers & Node.js (  ) – JavaScript features that make up Node (the event loop, streams, buffers, asynchronicity, prototypes)
- The Hard Parts of Object Oriented JavaScript (  ) – Organizing and scaling your code through understanding prototypes and classes in JavaScript
- The Hard Parts of Functional JavaScript (  ) – Functional programming techniques like Higher Order Functions, Function Composition, Pure Functions, and Immutability of State.
Announcing a New Entry to the ""Hard Parts"" Series ...
Today we're excited to release the latest addition in the series: The Hard Parts of UI Development (  ) !
Develop under-the-hood knowledge of UI development techniques such as data binding, UI composition, templating, virtual DOM and its reconciliation, and hooks, all from scratch!

Hover over an image to view it in full color. Chris’ Corner A collection of web design and development news and thoughts from CodePen's own Chris Coyier. If I were going to argue against @scope , the new CSS feature, I might say that CSS already has scope. Like, every selector is “scope”. If you say .el, you’re saying “scope this bit of CSS to elements that have the class name of ‘el'”. But then someone might tell you, ok, but what about “donut scope ” 🍩? Donut scope is a way for a scope to stop. Keith Grant shows that off in a recent article : @scope (.card) to (.slot) {
/* Scoped styles target only inside `.card` but not inside `.slot` */
:scope {
padding: 1rem;
background-color: white;
}
.title {
font-size: 1.2rem;
font-family: Georgia, serif;
}
} Imagine that applied to this HTML: <div class=""card"">
<h3 class=""title"">Moon lander <div class=""slot"">
<!-- scoped styles won’t target anything here! -->
</div>
</div> I’m not sure how I feel about that, honestly. Don’t hate it, but also can’t think of a time when I really really wanted that. That might be because it’s never existed so my brain didn’t try to reach for it. But container queries didn’t exist before, either, and I think we all pined for those anyway. Still, it’s a bit of a +1 for @scope because it’s a thing we can’t do any other way. If I was still arguing against @scope , then I’d say, well, it turns out actually you can replicate donut scope, thanks to another modern CSS feature, :has(), as Bramus blogged : .from ~ :has(~ .to) {
outline: 1px solid red;
} And actually, you don’t even need that . So I’m afraid I have to rescind the point I gave @scope . Are there any other tricks up its sleeve? It does have one! It’s called proximity . This is just kind of a bummer situation in CSS: <div class=""green"">
<p>I’m green</p>
<div class=""blue"">
<p>I’m blue</p>
</div>
</div> If you wrote the CSS like this: .blue p {
color: blue;
}
.green p {
color: green;
} Then both paragraphs are green . Just because the green selector came second. That’s just how CSS selectors work. Both have the same specificity so the latter one wins. We can fix this with scopes: @scope (.green) {
p {
color: green;
}
}
@scope (.blue) {
p {
color: blue;
}"

Maintain large-scale codebases with testing and automation,"We launched two new courses on leading code quality and design at scale.
Hi Ambarish,
What even is ""enterprise""? It means working effectively as a team and creating maintainable code that the team is happy to work together on. With that, we just launched two courses focused on working with others on large-scale applications:
- Enterprise UI Development (  ) with Steve Kinney
- Enterprise Design Systems Management (  ) with Ben Callahan
Within a few days, we received this feedback!
""I'm serious impressed with Enterprise UI Development and Enterprise Design Systems"" (  )
Enterprise UI Development (  )
Learn how to put together an infrastructure that will give you confidence when making changes—big or small.
The Three Ingredients of sustainable architecture (  )
We'll take a comprehensive look at testing. From the smallest unit test to component tests for multiple frameworks to browser-based integration tests using Playwright. Most importantly, you’ll add automation with GitHub actions so your systems, processes, and patterns work at scale.
Steve Kinney teaching his new Enterprise UI Development course (  )
Some other highlights include:
- Understand the basics of unit, component, and asymmetric testing
- Build a CI pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Automate accessibility testing and code coverage reports
- Use mocks and spies to test third-party libraries and API requests
- Creating complex integration tests with Playwright
- Enforce code standards with custom ESLint rules
Learn strategies for testing and leading the development of large projects! -->  (  )
Enterprise Design Systems Management (  )
This course is for technical and design leadership looking for strategies for leading, creating, and maturing your organization's design system beyond the technical perspective.
Venn diagram of the need for a design system (  )
You'll explore design systems, from anatomy and maturity models to adopting stakeholders, balancing consistency with flexibility, and the influence of organizational culture.
Improving the stages of adoption of your design system (  )
Some other highlights of what you'll learn:
- A holistic understanding of the anatomy of design systems
- The ways a design system can mature
- A framework for how to mature your design system
- A framework for maintaining system stability
- An understanding of the impact org culture has on a systems subculture
Learn how to lead a design system, from creation to adoption and maturity of the system! -->  (  )
Grab a membership today (  ) , and we hope you enjoy these new courses around leadership of code (  ) and design (  ) !

For the Good & Not So Good Parts of Summer…,We’ve Got You Covered
The latest from the front-end and fullstack worlds,"Get up to speed with what's going on in front-end, Node.js and beyond!
Hi Ambarish,
Frontend Masters remains, as ever, a site focused on bringing experts together to teach you modern front-end (and increasingly back-end) development skills. We've never been a direct news source, so it is high time we gave you a heads-up on some stories, releases, and projects that deserve a look.
Introducing the *Frontend to Fullstack Monthly Newsletter* !
We teamed up with our friends over at Frontend Focus (  ) and JavaScript Weekly (  ) to look over the past month in the front-end, JavaScript, and Node.js worlds and bring together the biggest stories that you'd find valuable.
Enjoy!
--
Marc Grabanski
CEO & UI Developer
Frontend Masters
*Frontend to Fullstack* : Issue #1
News updates
Node.js v20 (Current) Released (  ) – April's biggest release in our space was almost certainly Node.js v20, the latest version of the popular server-side runtime. It takes some cues from Deno in the shape of a new experimental permissions model. This is a feature Deno has at its core but now you can restrict access to certain capabilities in Node too.
Angular v16 Released (  ) — With the “biggest release since the initial rollout of Angular,” v16 of the extensive framework introduces a preview of a new signals-based reactivity model, RxJS interop, improved SSR and hydration, experimental esbuild support, Jest unit testing, and more.
🔒 An Update on the Web's Lock Icon (  ) — The use of a padlock icon in Web browsers has long symbolized the use of a secured connection to load a page, but now that HTTPS / TLS are the norm, is it time for a change? Google says yes, and proposes a curious looking alternative.
Other key releases recently include Vite 4.3 (  ) , TypeScript 5.1 Beta (  ) and Qwik 1.0. (  )
Handy tutorials
Can You Create Beautiful Stroked Text in CSS? (  ) — Explores several different approaches for creating stroked text (or outline text) in CSS and with SVGs.
Dissecting npm Malware: Five Packages and Their 'Evil' Install Scripts (  ) — npm related security continues to be a big topic and a common security vector is the install script that’s run when you install a package.
Optimizing Resource Loading with the Fetch Priority API (  ) — Fetch Priority (previously known as Priority Hints) indicates the relative priority of resources to the browser — it can enable optimal loading and improve Core Web Vitals. It’s currently supported in Chrome and Edge.
Passkeys: What and Why? (  ) — The author has been studying up and experimenting with passkeys — and the associated WebAuthn API that they are built on top of. This is a solid primer on an increasingly popular security option. FYI we also have a course on Web Auth that covers passkeys (  )
Exploring the Potential of Web Workers for Multithreading on the Web (  ) — A look at the importance of Web Workers for multithreading in the browser, including the limitations and considerations of using them and the strategies for mitigating potential issues.
Web Accessibility: A Reference to Creating Inclusive Websites (  ) — This solid guide covers some of the key principles and best practices to follow in order to create an inclusive user-friendly online experience for everyone.
CSS Text Balancing with text-wrap:balance (  ) — An exploration of new CSS text balancing features, including where it might come in useful. Browser support is limited for now, but it's a handy progressive enhancement in any case.
CSS Blend Modes (  ) — A look at what CSS blend modes are and how to use them with the background-blend-mode and mix-blend-mode properties. Lots of code and great interactive examples. All major browsers support them.
Useful projects
Babylon.js 6.0: The Powerful Web-Based 3D Framework (  ) — Babylon.js remains one of the world’s leading WebGL-based graphics engines with a visual scene builder and best-in-class physically-based rendering. v6.0 includes a new physics plugin, fluid rendering, major improvements to how reflections are handled, screen reader support, and more.
Modern Alternatives to Create React App (  ) — create-react-app has been the ‘go to’ for building single-page React apps for years, but this article touches on some of the alternatives now in common use.
Chart.js 4.3: Canvas-Based Charts for the Web (  ) — A long standing library that feels like it’s been there forever but still looks fresh and gets solid updates. Bar, line, area, bubble, pie, donut, scatter, and radar charts are all straightforward to produce.
Pico.css: A Minimal CSS Framework for Semantic HTML (  ) — The focus is more on styling native HTML elements, rather than littering your HTML with classes. Includes dark and light mode themes out-of-the-box.
And some random items
It turns out that even Nintendo has built a game in JavaScript. A developer discovered (  ) that 2015's Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Tipping Stars for the Wii U and 3DS was written with HTML and JavaScript under the hood and managed to build a shim to get it running in a normal browser.
Deno vs. Node: No One is Ready for the Move? (  ) — Deno (  ) has a lot going for it as an alternative to Node, but Node has time, maturity and a huge, established userbase on its side (and continues to develop, as seen with Node v20).

Rust for TypeScript Developers with ThePrimeagen,"ThePrimeagen is back to teach us the ""most loved"" language, Rust!
Hi Ambarish,
Rust has been voted the ""most loved"" coding language on the Stack Overflow survey for seven years in a row! ( see discussion on Reddit (  ) )
Leerob from Vercel declared Rust the language for the future of JavaScript infrastructure (  ). Many of the JavaScript ecosystem tools have been rewritten in Rust lately. Tools like Turbopack and even Tailwind tooling are being rewritten in Rust:
Creator of Tailwind, Adam Wathan rewrites part of Tailwind to Rust and experiences performance increase (  )
As a TypeScript developer, expanding your skills with Rust can be a game-changer to open up new opportunities for you in systems programming, WebAssembly, and performance-critical applications.
Who better to talk about the 'most loved' coding language than ThePrimeagen - who brings his signature energy, style and passion to his new Rust for TypeScript developers course (  ) !
ThePrimeagen teaching his new Rust for TypeScript devs course (  )
Rust for TypeScript Developers (  )
Rust offers memory safety without a garbage collector, impressive performance, and a strong type system similar to TypeScript, but with even more robustness.
You’ll use Vectors and Structs just like you use Arrays and Objects and use Options to handle null and undefined types. You’ll work your way up to creating custom trait implementations, making your code more modular and testable. ThePrimeagen also guides you through the core memory management concepts, including the Borrow Checker. Oh, and he uses Vim, by the way.
ThePrimeagen coding in Rust (  )
Here are some other key concepts covered in the course:
* Learn core constructs like Vectors, Tuples, and Structs
* Work with Iterators, Enums, and Options
* Understand the Borrow Checker and mutable/immutable references
* Explore the differences between Traits and Interfaces and the power of custom/generic Traits
Grab a membership today (  ) and we hope you enjoy learning Rust (  ) !

Connecting With Your Discord Friends Is About To Be Way Easier,"What you need to know about upcoming username changes
Hey HypeSquad,
While you’re (hopefully!) planning your summer vacation to lounge by the pool or camp in the forest, we’ve got a big update to share with you.
Let’s dive into something coming soon that’ll be important for all Discord users to be aware of— changes to our Username system.
We’re making changes to our username system by removing discriminators and introducing new, unique usernames (@username) and display names. This change will make sharing your username with friends easier and give you more control over your identity on Discord!
Since 2015, every Discord username has been cAsE sEnSitIvE and had a number attached to it called a discriminator (e.g., #0001). This lets you have the same username as someone else as long as you have different discriminators or different case letters. However, this also means you have to remember a set of 4-digit numbers and account for case sensitivity to connect with your friends. We wanted to make it easier for you to add your friends while preserving your ability to use your preferred name across Discord.
New usernames are lowercase, alphanumeric, limited to certain special characters, and do not have discriminators, making them easier to remember, read, type, and share. Now, rather than having to remember “PhiBi#8936,” you just say “I’m @phibiscool” and that’s it. Your new username will be unique to you, and when friends try to add you there won’t be any mistakes of the wrong discriminator or incorrect letter casing.
Display names are what’s shown to both your friends and communities. Think of them as server nicknames that work globally across Discord. You can change it whenever you want, and it can be whatever you want, including special characters, as long as it follows our community guidelines  If a username you were eyeing gets taken before you can claim it, no worries — you can still use it as a display name.
We know these are some big changes, but wanted to give you early notice since these will affect how you interact on Discord in the future.
Once this change rolls out for you, we’ll send a pop-up in-app for you to pick a new username. The older your Discord account, the sooner you will become eligible to pick a new username.
Until next time,
Discord Community Team

"Tetris Strategy, Data Doodles, and Retro Spacetime","View this issue on CodePen Tetris Strategy, Data Doodles, and Retro Spacetime This week's CodePen community highlights include a CSS :has()-powered Tetris strategy editor from Rock Starwind, a data doodle visualizing weather data from Sophia Wood, and a trippy space-time tunnel from Tom Miller. Plus, Jon Kantner builds the ""only"" keyboard you'll ever need to write code on a Mac, and Type Forward shows off the flexible fun of the Oddval Variable font. pen Spacetime Fall into a spacetime tunnel in this SVG animation from Tom Miller with satisfying retro style details. collection #CodePenChallenge: Handmade Texture We wrapped up April's ""Texture"" challenge with handmade inspiration. Weave your way through our collection from week four, including Pens from Josetxu , haz3y0ne , Christian Thorvik , and RAFA3L . pen Shader Gallery Take a tour of selected shader works by Matthias Hurrle in this roundup of highlights. Smash that follow button while you're at it, you'll be glad you did! pen Star Struck Chhavi Khandelwal paints a scene of wonder under the stars in this beautifully detailed pure CSS illustration. pen AI Inside Rainbow rings encircle a shadowy computer chip in this SVG loader animation from Chris Gannon that strikes an inspired balance between the inviting and the mysterious. pen SVG moving holes animation Expanding and contracting rectangles continuously circulate in a pleasing pattern in this ""SVG / SMIL fake 3D"" animation from CeramicSoda. pen data doodle - Salem OR temperature data Sophia Wood uses p5.js to visualize National Weather Service data on average temperatures in Salem, Oregon in three unique styles.

Type Forward demonstrates the flexible fun of the Oddval Variable font in this type specimen that cycles through the variable weights in an animated wave. Chris’ Corner A collection of web design and development news and thoughts from CodePen's own Chris Coyier.

You know what I mean, a headline with one silly little word that has wrapped down onto its own line. If only you could add a couple of soft returns in there to prevent it. You can, of course, but you know better. A soft return might fix a problem at one particular container width, that break causes an even more awkward problem at another container width. One technique that is sometimes employed is to insert an &nbsp; (non-breaking space) between the last two words (maybe even three?) of a headline (or paragraphs, if you’re nasty). This little piggy went to&nbsp;market None of us can be troubled to hand-code that if we’re in charge of the HTML of headlines regularly. I wrote my own PHP to split headlines by word and manually insert the non-breaking space on CSS-Tricks a decade or more ago. It can be done in client-side JavaScript too, naturally, but nobody wants to see that reflow. Finally, along comes the web platform with something that looks like a solution: h1, h2, h3 {
