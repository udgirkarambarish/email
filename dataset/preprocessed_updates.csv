Forked by Microsoft: When Open Source Meets Corporate Power,"View this post on the web at Welcome to HackerPulse Dispatch! Heres your weekly roundup of the latest developments in tech, ranging from serious security concerns to satirical software experiments. Microsoft has raised alarms over a surge in cyberattacks leveraging Node.js for stealthy data theft, while GitHub Copilot has drawn criticism after auto-enabling itself without user consent, raising fresh privacy concerns. EdgeDB engineers uncovered a rare ARM64 crash that slipped past Rusts safety net, ultimately traced back to a subtle thread-unsafe issue in the C standard library. On a lighter note, the TARIFF Python package offers a tongue-in-cheek take on software protectionism by letting devs delay imports to defend local code. Heres what new: Microsoft: Node.js Increasingly Used for Malware Delivery and Data Theft: Microsoft has warned about a surge in cyberattacks using Node.js to bypass detection, steal data, and maintain long-term access through phishing and malvertising tactics. C Stdlib Isnt Threadsafe and Even Safe Rust Didnt Save Us: EdgeDB engineers uncovered a rare ARM64 crash that bypassed Rusts safety guaranteestracing it back not to their own code, but to a subtle, thread-unsafe behavior in the C standard library. TARIFF: The Greatest, Most Tremendous Python Package That Makes Importing Great Again!: TARIFF is a satirical Python package that lets developers impose artificial delays on imports to protect local code because even numpy needs to pay its fair share. Github Copilot Auto Enabled Itself Without Consent: Devs report that Copilot auto-enabled across all VSCode workspaces after an update, overriding user preferences and raising serious concerns about privacy, control, and client data exposure. Getting Forked by Microsoft: A solo developer behind the Kubernetes tool Spegel recounts how early collaboration with Microsoft quietly turned into a copycat release, raising questions about ethics, licensing, and the future of open source. Microsoft: Node.js Increasingly Used for Malware Delivery and Data Theft (Read Paper ) Cybercriminals are finding new ways to exploit trusted tools, and Microsoft is sounding the alarm. A surge in sophisticated attacks leveraging Node.js is enabling threat actors to infiltrate systems, evade detection, and steal sensitive information. Since October 2024, Microsofts Defender Experts team has tracked multiple campaigns using Node.js in unexpected ways including in phishing and malvertising attacks. These tactics rely on the legitimate nature of Node.js to mask malware distribution, persistence, and data exfiltration. With attackers now packaging malicious JavaScript and executing it via node.exe, organizations face a rising threat hiding in plain sight. Key Points Node.js as a stealthy malware vehicle: Attackers are using Node.js to run compiled JavaScript files outside the browser, evading traditional security tools. These scripts enable silent system data collection and scheduled task creation. Malvertising meets cryptocurrency bait: Microsoft found campaigns that mimic popular crypto platforms like Binance to trick users into downloading infected software. Once installed, these programs modify Defender settings, download further payloads, and begin siphoning detailed system information. New phishing tricks with inline Node.js scripts: A separate attack method installs Node.js during phishing attacks and runs malicious JavaScript directly from the terminal. The scripts cloak C2 traffic as Cloudflare activity, perform reconnaissance, and alter registry keys for persistence. C Stdlib Isnt Threadsafe and Even Safe Rust Didnt Save Us ( Read Paper ) The EdgeDB team has been hard at work porting critical networking code from Python to Rustan ambitious project thats already delivering performance and stability wins. But during development of a new HTTP fetch feature, they encountered a mysterious failure that only appeared on ARM64 CI runners. The test suite passed with flying colors on x8664 and even locally on ARM machines, yet mysteriously hung during CI runs. Initial theories pointed to deadlocks or memory model differences between architectures. But after a deep dive into the Docker container, core dumps, and some classic gdb archaeology, they found something very different. Key Points The deadlock that wasnt: What looked like a classic async deadlock turned out to be a process crash silently masquerading as a hang. The CI logs showed no stacktracejust a test that spun for six hours until the job timed out. Why only ARM64?: The team suspected memory model quirks on ARM, which is known for its weaker ordering guarantees compared to Intel. GDB meets Docker meets GLIBC 2.17: Diagnosing the crash required copying shared libraries out of a minimal container and configuring gdb with the correct paths. The real culprit? A crash in the getenv function inside GLIBCnot their new Rust code at all. TARIFF: The Greatest, Most Tremendous Python Package That Makes Importing Great Again! ( Read Paper ) A bold new Python package has entered the arena and its putting foreign imports on notice. Meet TARIFF, a parody tool that lets developers impose import tariffs on Python packages, adding artificial delays to simulate protectionist programming policies. Want to slow down pandas by 200%? Go ahead. Need to penalize numpy for stealing your CPU cycles? TARIFFs got you covered. With customizable rates and patriotic console messages, TARIFF turns every import into a political statement parody-style. Key Points Imports with consequences: TARIFF lets developers set slowdown percentages on specific packages to simulate a ""tariffed"" import experience. Each taxed import comes with a glorious console message celebrating domestic code. Customizable slowdown settings: You can slap a 50% penalty on numpy, a 150% penalty on requests, or whatever your protectionist heart desires. TARIFF calculates the original import time and scales it with a delay to enforce the tariff. Because satire writes itself: TARIFF is completely satirical and shouldnt be used in production unless your goal is ironic protest coding. Github Copilot Auto Enabled Itself Without Consent (Read Paper ) A wave of concern is sweeping through the developer community after GitHub Copilot reportedly enabled itself across all VSCode workspaces without user consent. Developer rektbuildr raised the issue on GitHub (7963), describing how Copilot activated itself even in client projects where it had previously been disabled. With agent mode enabled, this raises serious concerns about the potential exposure of sensitive files, secrets, and proprietary code. Whats more troubling is that the change occurred silently after a system update, with users discovering the shift only after restarting their machines. This follows broader fears around Microsofts handling of opt-in privacy features, including the Recall tool and CoPilots expanding footprint. Key Points Consent ignored across workspaces: Copilot re-enabled itself across all open VSCode windows, even where it had previously been disabled for client confidentiality. The user had only approved Copilot in two windows, yet it activated itself elsewhere without any prompt or permission. Bypassing system settings: Even with GPO policies in place to block Copilot and running on unsupported hardware the tool started automatically after a Windows update. It created a new startup task, further indicating that opt-out controls may be ineffective. Growing trust concerns: The incident has reignited concerns about Microsoft pushing opt-out models for sensitive tools. Devs now question whether privacy switches will be respected in future updates, particularly for environments handling confidential code. Getting Forked by Microsoft ( Read Paper ) What starts as a story of collaboration ends with a cautionary tale about power dynamics in open source. After facing critical downtime due to GitHub container registry outages, one developer created Spegel a lightweight, stateless image mirroring tool for Kubernetes. The project gained traction, caught Microsofts attention, and prompted what looked like a promising collaboration. But months after technical discussions and support, Microsoft silently released Peerd, a strikingly similar tool, with function names, test cases, and even comments resembling those in Spegel. While the MIT license legally permits forking, the developer behind Spegel was left feeling side-stepped, disillusioned, and grappling with the broader implications for solo maintainers. Key Points Silent fork, loud disappointment: Microsoft launched Peerd a project with code and test cases nearly identical to Spegel without formally forking or clearly attributing the original author. Though the README gives a nod to Spegel, the developer only discovered the release while attending a KubeCon talk. MIT license, murky ethics: Spegels MIT license technically allows for reuse, but doesnt allow removing attribution and claiming authorship. Microsofts version reportedly omits license continuity, creating confusion and obscuring the original project's contributions. Maintainers versus megacorps: Despite Peerds release, Spegel still thrives with 1.7k stars and over 14 million pulls. But the experience has left the maintainer questioning how solo devs can coexist with tech giants and whether a licensing change is the only way to protect their work. And that's a wrap. Stay tuned and be the first to know whats happening in the industry!"

Key Insights: For job seekers - Seek out environments like Superpower where challenging leadership on ""A tasks"" is expected rather than discouraged - as Jacob notes, even the CEO regularly has team members question whether he's working on the highest-leverage priorities. For recruiters - Focus on finding ""full stack humans"" who can work across multiple domains from high-level strategy to detailed implementation, as they require fewer handoffs and dramatically increase shipping velocity. For founders - Document extensively before meetings, with team members reviewing materials asynchronously first.

Why it matters: In Sean's words, ""Most of the time that I get 'nos' on candidates, it's not that they couldn't do the work. It's that they struggled to answer the questions."" He recommends: Treating interview prep like studying for an exam Using the exact terminology from the job description Practicing explaining how your skills match their requirements Asking friends to test you with mock interview questions Do not to wing it - even strong candidates fail when they struggle to articulate answers For more tips from Sean about technical interviews watch our full 'Ask a Recruiter' Q&A with him here.

"Altman, Gates, & McKinnon Agree: AI Isnt Replacing Software Engineers","View this post on the web at Hiring Engineers: Build the AI Landlord Landlord is a well-funded startup building autonomous property software that manages millions of tenantsthink billionaire-level property management for everyone. Were looking for elite full-stack devs who use AI, not fear it. Thousands of tenants already rely on our AI property manager. (Yes, you can use AI on the test. We expect it.) Welcome to HackerPulse Dispatch! Heres your weekly roundup of the latest stories in techfrom AIs evolving role as a collaborator rather than a replacement, to the long-term demand for skilled software engineers. Were delving into new research on why clear, readable code often takes more expertise than flashy one-liners, the mounting frustration devs face cleaning up AI-generated messes, and NVIDIAs major move to bring native Python support to CUDAmarking a turning point in accelerating AI, machine learning, and scientific computing. Heres what new: Sam Altman Says AI Will Make Coders 10X More Productive, Not Replace Them Even Bill Gates Claims the Field Is Too Complex: OpenAIs CEO says he plans to use artificial intelligence to make software engineers more productivenot replace them. Oktas CEO Tells Us Why He Thinks Software Engineers Will Be More in Demand in 5 Years Not Less: Okta CEO Todd McKinnon says fears of AI replacing software engineers are overblown, predicting instead that demand for engineers will grow as AI enhances productivity and fuels new product innovation. Clever Code Is Probably the Worst Code You Could Write: Clear, readable code may look simple, but it often requires far more effort, iteration, and skill than clever one-linersespecially in real-world engineering. AI Coding Mandates Are Driving Developers to the Brink: Despite executive optimism about AIs success in the workplace, devs express frustration over technical issues, errors, and the challenges of AI tool mandates, highlighting a growing divide in expectations. NVIDIA Drops a Game-Changer: Native Python Support Hits Cuda: NVIDIA has added native Python support to CUDA, enabling developers to write GPU-accelerated code directly in Python for faster, simpler AI and scientific computing. Sam Altman Says AI Will Make Coders 10X More Productive, Not Replace Them Even Bill Gates Claims the Field Is Too Complex ( Read Paper ) As generative AI becomes more powerful, concern over job security is spreading across industries. Reports suggest that a significant percentage of jobsincluding 54% in bankingcould be automated entirely. Coding, once seen as future-proof, is now in the crosshairs, with NVIDIAs CEO declaring it potentially obsolete and encouraging alternative career paths. OpenAI's Sam Altman, however, takes a more nuanced view, focusing on enhancing coder productivity rather than replacing developers outright. Meanwhile, executives continue to express concern over the AI skills gap, even as AI aptitude becomes a near-mandatory requirement in hiring. Key Points Conflicting Narratives: Altman and Gates both suggest survival for codersthough Gates believes only complex roles like biotech and energy will endure. Automation Anxiety: While full replacement is possible, the near future likely revolves around using AI to handle repetitive tasks, not whole professions. Oktas CEO Tells Us Why He Thinks Software Engineers Will Be More in Demand in 5 Years Not Less ( Read Paper ) Despite rising concerns that AI will shrink the software engineering workforce, Okta CEO Todd McKinnon believes the opposite is true. In an interview with Business Insider, McKinnon dismissed the idea of declining demand for engineers, citing historical patterns where technological revolutions only increased the need for talent. He argued that while AI may handle repetitive coding tasks, it will elevate engineers to focus on broader system design and innovation. McKinnon also pointed to the ""infinite demand"" for automation and new products, predicting more job creationnot less. While some tech giants freeze hiring or lean on AI-generated code, McKinnon says the data will soon prove them wrong. Key Points Job growth forecast: McKinnon predicts the number of software engineers will increase over the next five years, driven by surging demand for digital products that outpaces any efficiency gains from AI tools. Upskilling, not downsizing: He believes AI will automate repetitive coding but push engineers into more strategic roles focused on complex systems, architecture, and innovationmaking them more productive, not obsolete. Historical echo: Citing past tech shifts like compilers and the mobile revolution, McKinnon argues that each productivity leap led to more engineering jobs, not fewer, and AI will follow that same trajectory. Clever Code Is Probably the Worst Code You Could Write ( Read Paper ) Writing code thats easy to read may seem simple, but behind the scenes, its often the result of intense effort, iteration, and thoughtful structure. A former undergrad-turned-engineer reflects on how code golfing on Leetcode gave a misleading impression of what good engineering looks like. While clever one-liners might win points in a challenge, they often fail in real-world environments where clarity and maintainability matter most. Through experience at a major tech company, the author learned that clean code often gets mistaken for easy codeand may even require documentation to prove its complexity for performance reviews. The lesson: readable, maintainable code is a sign of mastery, not mediocrity. Key Points Clear code takes work: Achieving clean, understandable code often involves multiple iterations, careful refactoring, and thoughtful structuringnot just solving the problem. Clever good: While clever code may look impressive, its typically harder to debug and maintain, making it a liability in production environments. Perception problem: In big tech companies, simple-looking code can be undervalued during performance reviews, pushing engineers to write documentation just to highlight the real complexity behind it. AI Coding Mandates Are Driving Developers to the Brink ( Read Paper ) A recent survey revealed that nearly half of C-suite executives believe AI adoption is tearing their company apart, highlighting a growing divide between leadership and employees on the use of AI tools. While 75% of executives feel their AI integration has been successful, only 45% of employees share this view, with developers expressing frustration over AI tools introducing errors, increasing technical debt, and exacerbating deployment issues. These tools, despite their potential to boost productivity, are being rolled out with little understanding of engineering workflows, leading to misguided mandates and decreased effectiveness. Some companies, however, are finding success by empowering their developers with flexible AI tool options and fostering a culture of trust and collaboration. Key Points Leadership's optimism vs. developer frustration: While 75% of executives believe AI adoption has been successful, only 45% of employees share that view, with developers pointing to technical debt and AI tool-related errors as major concerns. AI tools' impact on code quality: Many devs report that AI coding tools frequently introduce incorrect code and cause more debugging work, with 67% of engineers spending more time on error resolution due to AI-generated code. Success through flexibility: Companies like ChargeLab that allow devs to choose their AI tools and adapt them to their specific needs have seen a 40% productivity boost, proving that empowering engineers leads to more successful AI adoption. NVIDIA Drops a Game-Changer: Native Python Support Hits Cuda ( Read Paper ) NVIDIA has officially introduced native Python support in its CUDA toolkit, a major shift that lets developers tap into GPU acceleration without leaving Python. This move comes as Python tops GitHubs 2024 rankings as the worlds most popular programming language, surpassing JavaScript. By eliminating the need for C or third-party wrappers, NVIDIA is making high-performance computing more accessible for AI, machine learning, and scientific research. The update includes new tools like cuNumeric and supports just-in-time (JIT) compilation for optimized GPU code written directly in Python. While not perfect yet, this change dramatically lowers the barrier to entry for millions of Python developers worldwide. Key Points AI development gets a speed boost: Native Python support allows coders to stay in their preferred language while accelerating model training and data processing on GPUs. This streamlines AI workflows and reduces reliance on C or complex toolchains. Bigger dev community, bigger market: With Pythons global reach, this update opens CUDA to millions more developers, especially in emerging tech markets. It also strengthens NVIDIAs position as the default platform for accelerated computing. And that's a wrap! Keep staying abreast of cutting-edge tech developments."

"Tracing Tokens, Cinematic Camera Paths, and Multimodal Reasoning","View this post on the web at Welcome to this weeks AI Fridays, where we explore innovations in reasoning, creativity, and model transparency. Skywork R1V offers efficient multimodal reasoning in a compact form, while OLMoTrace lets us trace LLM outputs back to trillions of training tokens. We unpack how quantization affects reasoning tasks, dive into DDTs fast and effective diffusion transformer architecture, and explore GenDoPa cinematic AI model that directs 3D camera movements with flair. Heres whats new: Skywork R1V: A compact 38B multimodal model combining vision and text with Chain-of-Thought reasoning. OLMoTrace: Real-time tracing of LLM outputs to original training data for transparency and fact-checking. Quantization vs. Reasoning: New research reveals where quantization degrades reasoningand where it doesnt. DDT: A diffusion transformer that separates semantics and detail for faster, state-of-the-art image generation. GenDoP: An autoregressive model that generates camera motion like a pro cinematographer in 3D scenes. Skywork R1V: Pioneering Multimodal Reasoning with Chain-of-Thought ( Read the Paper ) Skywork R1V introduces an efficient multimodal reasoning model that combines language and vision capabilities through a lightweight visual projector and hybrid optimization strategy, achieving competitive performance on visual-language benchmarks while maintaining strong textual reasoning abilities, all with a relatively compact 38B parameter footprint. OLMoTrace: Tracing Language Model Outputs Back to Trillions of Training Tokens ( Read the Paper ) OLMoTrace is a groundbreaking open-source system that rapidly traces language model outputs back to their original training data from trillions of tokens, enabling real-time analysis of model behavior, fact-checking, and investigation of hallucinations. Quantization Hurts Reasoning? An Empirical Study on Quantized Reasoning Models ( Read the Paper ) This first systematic study of quantization effects on reasoning language models reveals that while moderate quantization (W8A8 or W4A16) maintains performance, aggressive bit-width reduction significantly degrades accuracy across mathematical, scientific, and programming tasks, with model size, origin, and task complexity being key performance factors. DDT: Decoupled Diffusion Transformer ( Read the Paper ) DDT introduces a decoupled architecture for diffusion transformers that separates semantic encoding from high-frequency decoding, achieving state-of-the-art FID scores on ImageNet while training 4x faster and enabling faster inference through self-condition sharing between denoising steps. GenDoP: Auto-regressive Camera Trajectory Generation as a Director of Photography ( Read the Paper) GenDoP introduces a groundbreaking auto-regressive model for generating artistic camera trajectories in 3D scenes, trained on a novel 29K-shot dataset of professional cinematography, enabling text-guided camera movements that achieve both technical excellence and creative expression."

13 Laws Most Engineers Break & Why DevOps Was a Bad Idea,"View this post on the web at Welcome to HackerPulse Dispatch! Heres your weekly roundup of the biggest tech stories, serving up everything from project delays shrouded in mystery to KPIs that went rogue. We're exploring the latest revelations about the true nature of software engineering with 13 revealing laws, all while keeping a pulse on the hype and reality checks surrounding AI in software development. Plus, we'll explore the insanity of being a modern software engineerconstantly under pressure to master new tools and keep up with rapidly evolving technologies. And dont miss our take on how formalizing the DevOps role mightve actually undermined the spirit of DevOps itself. Heres what new: The Insanity of Being a Software Engineer: Did you know that modern software engineers are expected to be full-stack experts, infrastructure managers, and team leaders all at once with no sign of the complexity slowing down. The 13 Software Engineering Laws: Thirteen cheeky-yet-true laws reveal why engineering projects run late, teams get bloated, metrics get gamedand why every product eventually tries to read your email. In Retrospect, DevOps Was a Bad Idea: DevOps began as a mindset of developer ownership over production, but naming it and turning it into a separate role ultimately reversed the very progress it was meant to achieve. Celebrating 50 Years of Microsoft: Microsofts 50th anniversary marks a reflection on Bill Gates early mistakes, including political naivety and team-building misjudgments, which were pivotal in shaping the companys journey from its humble beginnings to becoming a tech giant. Programming With an AI Copilot: My Perspective as a Senior Dev: While AI tools are touted as productivity boosters in software development, devs warn that they are simply an evolution of existing tools and still require human expertise to ensure quality and safety. The Insanity of Being a Software Engineer (Read Paper ) The software engineering world isnt what it used to be. What began as a job for specialists has morphed into a full-blown juggling act of languages, frameworks, infrastructure tools, and management responsibilities. Engineers today are expected to be full-stack polyglots, mastering everything from CSS quirks to cloud provisioning, often while simultaneously managing teams. The pressure to constantly keep up with evolving technologies React, TypeScript, Docker, Terraform, and more has turned learning on the job into a never-ending marathon. And just when you think youve reached the summit, surprise! Youre now also the manager. Key Points The rise of the full-stack warrior: Companies expect engineers to handle both front-end (hello, React) and back-end work without expanding the team ushering in the era of the full-stack developer. Os is now your job too: With the death of traditional sysadmins, DevOps became a developer duty meaning Docker, AWS, and infrastructure-as-code are now part of the required toolkit. No end in sight: Promotions bring no relief; they just shift the challenge. Managing teams, estimating deadlines, and reviewing code becomes the new normal while still handling the technical load in smaller orgs. The 13 Software Engineering Laws ( Read Paper ) Some are legendary, some are obscure, but all are shockingly useful especially if you manage engineers (or just want to survive a sprint planning meeting). These 13 laws arent laws in the legal sense, but they are eerily accurate descriptions of how work, teams, and software behave in the wild. Key Points Projects expand, collapse, and never go as planned: Parkinsons Law, Hofstadters Law, and Murphys Law explain why work always takes longer than expected and why something will definitely go wrong the night before a launch. Add in Brooks Law, and youll see why throwing more people at a late project just adds more chaos, not speed. Structure predicts product (and mess): Conways Law, Inverse Conways Law, and the Ringelmann Effect show how team org charts shape software and how bigger teams often mean lazier individuals. Prices Law warns that most output comes from a few people, while Zawinskis Law and Hyrums Law remind you that every feature grows until it reads email and becomes a sacred legacy no one dares remove. Metrics mislead, but silence is worse: Goodharts Law and Gilbs Law track the wrong thing, and people will optimize the fun right out of it. Sturgeons Law suggests 90% of ideas (and features) are garbage, while Cunninghams Law says the fastest way to fix a mistake is to confidently post the wrong solution in public. In Retrospect, DevOps Was a Bad Idea (Read Paper ) In the early days, DevOps wasnt a formalized roleit was simply a natural evolution of engineering culture that encouraged devs to take responsibility for deploying and running their own code. This organic shift led to a healthier, more efficient development process, where production became a shared concern rather than an isolated function. Devs who cared about reliability and user experience began owning the deployment pipelines, monitoring live systems, and automating operations in ways that made their entire teams more productive. But the moment we labeled this practice DevOps and turned it into a distinct job title, everything started to unravel. By separating DevOps into its own function, organizations effectively reversed the very progress the movement had maderemoving deployment ownership from product teams and reintroducing the silos it was meant to dissolve. Key Points The original intent was developer empowerment: DevOps emerged from developers embracing ownership of productionautomating deployments, monitoring live systems, and ensuring software ran smoothly end-to-end. Naming it created a counterproductive division: Once DevOps became a job title, companies spun up specialized teams that disconnected production expertise from product development. Modern DevOps emphasizes control over trust: Today's DevOps teams often prioritize compliance and abstraction over enablement, slowing developers down with restrictive tooling and outdated assumptions about risk. Celebrating 50 Years of Microsoft ( Read Paper ) Microsoft is celebrating its 50th anniversary this month, and co-founder Bill Gates reflected on the company's journey, including both successes and missteps. He acknowledged critical mistakes made during the companys early years, notably underestimating the importance of government relations, which led to the infamous antitrust case in the 1990s. Key Points Gates' Early Regrets: Bill Gates admits underestimating the importance of government relations, which led to the antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft in the 1990s. Microsoft's Humble Beginnings: The companys founding was driven by Gates and Paul Allens scramble to create software for the Altair 8800, leading to the development of its first operating system. Reflections on Success and Growth: Despite early missteps, Microsoft has evolved into a trillion-dollar tech giant, with Gates recognizing the impact of personal computing and team-building lessons. Programming With an AI Copilot: My Perspective as a Senior Dev ( Read Paper ) As AI tools flood the software development industry, a critical perspective is missing amid the hype and marketing promises of increased productivity. While AI is seen as a game-changer, many devs argue it's just an evolution of existing tools. AI's impact is largely misunderstood, and its implementation still requires deep technical knowledge to ensure safety and quality. Despite its growing presence, devs stress that AI remains a toolnot a replacementfor the essential skills of problem-solving, creativity, and critical thinking. Key Points AI-assisted development tools are evolving but not revolutionary: While marketing promises faster productivity, AI is simply another step in the evolution of developer tools, like Eclipse or Stack Overflow, which have never replaced developers. The hidden challenges of AI-driven code generation: Although AI tools like ChatGPT can produce code, they often lack context, resulting in unsafe or incorrect code, and require developers' expertise to correct and ensure quality. And that's a wrap! Stay tuned on the latest tech news and sentiment."

Competition Launch: Image Matching 2025,"Kaggle Hi Ambarish Udgirkar, Finishing a puzzle can be hard enough, but what if pieces from other puzzles were mixed in, too? This makes the task even harder since you now have to find only the pieces you need. The same challenge applies to building 3D scenes from real-world image sets, where unrelated photos are lumped together with relevant ones, complicating accurate scene reconstruction. In this competition, you'll train a machine learning model to sort through mixed image collections, group the right ones, and rebuild accurate 3D scenes. Total Prizes: 50,000 Entry Deadline: June 2, 2025 Learn More Your work could improve how we use images in augmented reality, robotics, and even scientific research.

"Multi-Agent Science, LEGO Reasoning, and Open-Source Search","View this post on the web at Welcome to this weeks AI Fridays, where reasoning takes center stage. Explore MAPS, a multi-agent framework guided by personality traits and Socratic methods for scientific problem solving. Dive into LEGO-Puzzles to see how MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning, and learn how Open Deep Search rivals proprietary search with open-source agents. Plus, see how BizGen redefines infographic generation and how unconditional priors boost the quality of conditional diffusion outputs. Heres whats new: MAPS: Multi-agent LLMs guided by Big Seven personalities and Socratic dialogue outperform prior models on scientific tasks. LEGO-Puzzles: A new benchmark reveals that MLLMs fall far short of human-level spatial reasoning. Open Deep Search: An open-source web-augmented reasoning framework that outperforms GPT-4o Search Preview. Unconditional Priors: Using base model noise improves conditional diffusion outputsno retraining required. BizGen: Turning articles into dense, high-quality infographics using layout-aware attention and a massive dataset. MAPS: A Multi-Agent Framework Based on Big Seven Personality and Socratic Guidance for Multimodal Scientific Problem Solving ( Read More) MAPS introduces a novel multi-agent framework that combines Big Seven personality traits with Socratic questioning to solve complex multimodal scientific problems, demonstrating superior performance with a 15.84% improvement over existing models while enabling more sophisticated reasoning and self-reflection capabilities. LEGO-Puzzles: How Good Are MLLMs at Multi-Step Spatial Reasoning? ( Read More ) The study introduces LEGO-Puzzles, a novel benchmark that reveals significant limitations in current MLLMs' spatial and sequential reasoning capabilities, with even top-performing models achieving only 50% accuracy compared to humans' 90% on tasks involving LEGO-based spatial understanding and multi-step reasoning. Open Deep Search: Democratizing Search with Open-source Reasoning Agents ( Read More ) Open Deep Search (ODS) introduces an open-source framework that combines reasoning agents with web search capabilities to augment existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance that rivals or exceeds proprietary solutions, demonstrated by its 9.7% accuracy improvement over GPT-4o Search Preview on the FRAMES benchmark and strong performance on SimpleQA. Unconditional Priors Matter! Improving Conditional Generation of Fine-Tuned Diffusion Models ( Read More ) This paper demonstrates that using the unconditional noise predictions from pre-trained base models, rather than from fine-tuned models, significantly improves the quality of conditional diffusion model generation across multiple domains, addressing a fundamental limitation in classifier-free guidance without requiring additional training. BizGen: Advancing Article-level Visual Text Rendering for Infographics Generation BizGen advances infographics generation through a novel layout-guided attention scheme and a large-scale Infographics-650K dataset, enabling high-quality business content creation from article-length prompts while handling ultra-dense layouts with hundreds of sub-regions."

The Fantasy & Risks of Vibe Coding,"View this post on the web at Welcome to HackerPulse Dispatch! This week, we've got a full slate of tech updates. From the 8.8 trillion open-source sector driving the digital economy to a critical Next.js vulnerability that puts middleware at risk, weve got you covered. Well also explore the rise of vibe coding and how the accelerators latest startups use AI to generate 95% of their code. Heres what new: Harvard Study: Open Source Has an Economic Value of 8.8 Trillion Dollars: Open-source software delivers 8.8 trillion in economic value, yet a small group of developers drives most contributions, raising concerns about sustainability and corporate support. Why Im No Longer Talking To Architects About Microservices: Microservices debates are often unproductive, as vague definitions, lack of business alignment, and organizational bottlenecks hinder meaningful progress. Next.js Middleware Exploit: Cve-2025-29927 Authorization Bypass: A critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-29927) in Next.js allows attackers to bypass middleware security using the x-middleware-subrequest header, impacting authentication, security headers, and access controls. 95% AI-Written Code? Unpacking the Y Combinator CEOs Developer Jobs Bombshell: Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan says 25% of its latest startups use AI to write 95% of their code, reducing the need for large engineering teams but raising questions about long-term software quality and developer hiring trends. Vibe Coding Is a Dangerous Fantasy: A recent incident with a ""vibe coder"" highlights the dangers of relying on AI-generated code without understanding its architecture and security. Harvard Study: Open Source Has an Economic Value of 8.8 Trillion Dollars ( Read Paper ) Open-source software is a massive economic force, with an estimated value of 8.8 trillionabout 3.5 times what companies would spend on proprietary alternatives. A Harvard Business School study found that just 3,000 developers worldwide are responsible for 95% of this value, and open-source code appears in 96% of all codebases. Despite its economic impact, open-source development itself costs only around 4.15 billion, a fraction of the demand value. The study highlights how a small number of developers drive the majority of contributions, emphasizing the need for greater corporate and governmental support. With open-source software acting as a modern common good, experts warn against its overuse without proper reinvestment. Key Points Open-source fuels the economy: Without it, companies would spend 3.5x more on software, with open-source contributions valued at 8.8 trillion. Go leads in demand: The Go programming language drives over 5 trillion in commercial valuemore than four times that of JavaScript, Java, and Python. A few carry the load: Just 5% of developers are behind 93% of open-source contributions, sparking concerns about sustainability and corporate investment. Why Im No Longer Talking To Architects About Microservices ( Read Paper ) Microservices discussions often lead nowhere, as architects debate vague definitions rather than solving real problems. Without a clear consensus on what a microservice is, conversations quickly become abstract and disconnected from business goals. Worse, implementing microservices without organizational change is a recipe for failure, as they require autonomous teams and decentralized decision-making to function properly. Instead of fixating on microservices as an end in themselves, teams should focus on concrete challenges like reducing cycle time and improving reliability. In short, technology should serve business needsnot the other way around. Key Points Definition chaos: Without a clear definition, microservices discussions turn into circular debates that fail to drive real decisions. Business disconnect: Teams focus on microservices as a concept rather than addressing real bottlenecks like deployment speed and system reliability. Organizational bottlenecks: Microservices only work when supported by autonomous teams and decentralized decision-makingwithout that, they just add complexity. Next.js Middleware Exploit: Cve-2025-29927 Authorization Bypass (Read Paper ) A newly discovered vulnerability (CVE-2025-29927) in Next.js allows attackers to bypass middleware security using the x-middleware-subrequest header. Affecting multiple versions from 11.1.4 through unpatched v14.x and v15.x, this flaw compromises authentication, security headers, and content restrictions. With a CVSS score of 9.1, it poses a severe risk to applications relying on middleware for security controls. Immediate updates or mitigations are strongly recommended to prevent exploitation. Key Points How it works: Attackers manipulate a built-in recursion prevention mechanism, tricking Next.js into skipping security checks. The flaw allows unauthorized access, CSP bypasses, and even cache poisoning attacks. Affected versions: Next.js versions 11.1.4 to 15.2.2 are vulnerable, but patches are available in versions 12.3.5, 13.5.9, 14.2.25, and 15.2.3. Users should update immediately or apply mitigations. Mitigation steps: Block the x-middleware-subrequest header at the proxy level, enforce WAF rules, or add extra authentication layers in API routes to reduce exposure. 95% AI-Written Code? Unpacking the Y Combinator CEOs Developer Jobs Bombshell ( Read Paper ) Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan revealed that around 25% of the accelerators latest startups use AI to generate 95% or more of their code, reducing the need for large engineering teams. This shift could lower hiring demand in tech startups while increasing investor pressure for profitability. While AI speeds up development, experts caution that human oversight is still essential for quality, scalability, and long-term viability. As AI-generated code becomes more common, startups may delay hiring engineers until later stages of product development. Despite these efficiencies, AI is unlikely to fully replace software developers, as architecture and problem-solving still require human expertise. Key Points Smaller startup teams: AI-generated code allows startups to scale with fewer engineers, making capital stretch further and lowering hiring barriers for founders. Human oversight is key: AI-generated code requires expert review to ensure security, performance, and long-term scalability. Shifting hiring trends: Startups may rely on AI for MVPs but will still need skilled engineers to refine and maintain products as they grow. Vibe Coding Is a Dangerous Fantasy ( Read Paper ) A recent incident highlighted the risks of ""vibe coding,"" where an AI-assisted SaaS built without understanding the underlying code was compromised by security flaws. The founder admitted that their lack of technical knowledge slowed down their ability to resolve issues, underlining the dangers of relying on AI-generated code without understanding whats behind it. While AI tools offer impressive support in coding, they can also obscure critical complexities, creating a false sense of security. The reality is that without a basic grasp of architecture, security, and coding principles, building software can lead to catastrophic failures. Key Points Understanding architecture matters: Even with AI tools, understanding how data flows, where its stored, and its protection is crucial. Vibe coders should prioritize learning and engaging with the underlying architecture. AI is an educational tool: Use AI for more than just coding; ask it to explain security concerns and guide you through what could go wrong with your code. This builds a deeper understanding of your project. Basic security practices are essential: Implement foundational security measures like HTTPS, authentication, and environment variables from day one, ensuring your product is secure and reliable. And that's a wrap! Stay tuned for next weeks tech breakthroughs."

Learn how DAPO is making reinforcement learning for LLMs reproducible and high-performing, and how Creation-MMBench pushes the boundaries of context-aware creative intelligence in multimodal models. Explore SmolDocling, a tiny but mighty VLM for document conversion, TULIPs unified language-image pretraining framework, and a deep dive into failure modes of clustering sliding-window time series data. Heres whats new: Sliding Window Clustering: Three failure modes explainedwhen time series clustering breaks down. DAPO: A fully open-source RL system for LLMs that hits SOTA on AIME 2024 and closes the reproducibility gap. SmolDocling: A 256M VLM that competes with models 27x its size for document conversion tasks. TULIP: Unifying language-image pretraining with generative augmentation and contrastive learning. Creation-MMBench: Benchmarking creative intelligence in multimodal modelsand where open models fall short. On the clustering behavior of sliding windows ( Read the Paper ) The study reveals three distinct failure modes when clustering sliding-window-processed time series data, providing theoretical proofs and examples for how window size relative to series length can produce meaningless clusters, symmetry-based inefficiencies, and forced interval groupings. DAPO: An Open-Source LLM Reinforcement Learning System at Scale ( Read the Paper ) DAPO introduces a novel open-source reinforcement learning system for LLMs that achieves state-of-the-art performance (50 points on AIME 2024) while providing full transparency of its training techniques and code, addressing the reproducibility gap in current LLM research. SmolDocling: An ultra-compact vision-language model for end-to-end multi-modal document conversion ( Read the Paper ) SmolDocling is a breakthrough 256M-parameter vision-language model that performs end-to-end document conversion by generating DocTags markup, achieving comparable performance to models 27x larger while efficiently processing diverse document types and elements like code, tables, equations, and charts in their full spatial context. TULIP: Towards Unified Language-Image Pretraining ( Read the Paper ) TULIP introduces a unified language-image pretraining framework that bridges the gap between vision-centric and language-aligned models, achieving state-of-the-art performance through generative data augmentation and enhanced contrastive learning while significantly outperforming existing models like SigLIP across multiple vision and language benchmarks. Creation-MMBench: Assessing Context-Aware Creative Intelligence in MLLM ( Read the Paper ) Creation-MMBench introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating creative intelligence in multimodal AI systems through 765 image-based test cases, revealing that current open-source models significantly lag behind proprietary ones and that visual fine-tuning can actually impair base creative capabilities.

"Incorrect deserialization of negative int64 values for users of the useBigInt64 option in the JavaScript bson library, the Node.js Driver and MongoDB Shell","Dear MongoDB Customer, We have identified a critical issue affecting the bson JavaScript library, which is included in the MongoDB Node.js driver. When theuseBigInt64 option is enabled (it is disabled by default), this results in negativeInt64 values being deserialized as large positive values (greater than 9,223,372,036,854,775,807). If you explicitly enable the useBigInt64 option, the following libraries that include the impactedbson library could be affected: MongoDB Node.js driver 6.0.0 - 6.13.0 Mongoose 8.3.5 - 8.10.1 // examples showing impacted operations via the Node.js driver const client new MongoClient('.../?useBigInt64true'); const client new MongoClient('...', useBigInt64: true ); const collection client.db('db', useBigInt64: true ).collection('test'); const collection client.db('db').collection('test', useBigInt64: true ); const document await collection.findOne( id , useBigInt64: true ); // example using BSON library directly const bigint -1n; const bytes BSON.serialize( bigint ); const document BSON.deserialize(bytes, useBigInt64: true ); You are not impacted by these issues if you are not using the useBigInt64 option explicitly, such as via above methods. The impacted bson library is also included in the following applications: MongoDB Shell 2.2.0 - 2.3.9 Compass 1.42.3-beta.4 - 1.45.3 VS Code Extension 1.6.1 - 1.12.0 However, passing useBigInt64true via URI options will not trigger the bug; useBigInt64: true and promoteLongs: true must be passed directly to an operation via the shell or embedded shell. The following MUST be true for the bug to potentially affect an application: An affected version of the bson library is used (either directly, or as a dependency of another library such as the Node.js driver); The useBigInt64 option must be enabled (default is disabled); and A negative BSON Int64 value is deserialized via the bson library, which will deserialize it as a positive value greater than 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 ( 0x7fffffffffffffff). If your application is using an affected version of bson, the MongoDB Node.js driver or Mongoose (as described above), please update thebson dependency as follows: npm update bson If you have a direct dependence on bson in your project's package.json, run the following: npm install bsonVERSION Where VERSION is the patch/minor version acceptable for your project's update constraints. If there are no constraints,VERSION can be latest (ex: bsonlatest ). If you are using an affected version of one of the MongoDB-supplied applications affected by this issue, please update to at least the following versions: Mongosh 2.4.0 Compass 1.45.4 VS Code 1.12.1 If you have any questions, please open a support case or start a chat with the Atlas Support team.

"Developer Convicted for Kill Switch, Github Security Alert, & More","View this post on the web at Welcome to HackerPulse Dispatch! We've got a jam-packed update for you, delving into the latest tech headlinesfrom the GitHub Action tj-actions/changed-files breach to TypeScript's impressive 10x performance boost. Plus, we'll explore why asking stupid questions is actually a superpower, the rising trend of companies forcing AI on devs, and a shocking case of a dev facing up to 10 years in prison for deploying malicious code that sabotaged his former employer's network. Heres what new: A 10X Faster Typescript: TypeScript is getting a native compiler, delivering a 10x speed boost, faster editor performance, and reduced memory usage, with a full rollout expected by the end of 2025. Developer Convicted for Kill Switch Code Activated Upon His Termination: A former software developer was convicted of sabotaging his employers network with malicious code, including a kill switch that triggered upon his termination, and now faces up to 10 years in prison. As an Engineer, Id Rather Be Called Stupid Than Stay Silent: Did you know that embracing vulnerability and asking stupid questions fosters learning, strengthens collaboration, and accelerates career growth? Forcing AI on Developers Is a Bad Idea That Is Going to Happen: JetBrains decision to embed a non-removable AI Assistant in its IDEs highlights the dangers of forced feature adoption, sparking concerns over developer autonomy, security, and compliance. Popular Github Action Tj-Actions/Changed-Files Is Compromised: The popular GitHub Action tj-actions/changed-files has been compromised, exposing secrets in CI pipelines. A 10X Faster Typescript (Read Paper ) The core value of TypeScript has always been an excellent developer experience, but as projects grow, performance bottlenecks emerge. Large codebases face long load and check times, forcing developers to compromise between fast editor startup and a full project view. AI-powered features also require faster access to semantic data, while command-line builds need to validate entire projects efficiently. To solve these challenges, TypeScript is going nativebringing a drastic boost in speed, memory usage, and responsiveness. Key Points Native compiler rewrite: TypeScript is getting a native implementation, expected to cut most build times by 10x, improve editor startup speeds, and reduce memory usage significantly. A preview for command-line typechecking is targeted for mid-2025, with full project builds and language service support by the end of the year. Blazing-fast editor experience: With the new native implementation, loading the Visual Studio Code codebase in an editor drops from 9.6 seconds to just 1.2 secondsan 8x improvement. This means faster navigation, instant error listings, and near-instant refactorings, all while cutting memory usage in half. Roadmap to TypeScript 7: The current JS-based codebase will continue development into TypeScript 6.x, with TypeScript 7.0 marking the switch to the native compiler. While some projects may migrate immediately, TypeScript 6 will be maintained until TypeScript 7 reaches full maturity. Developer Convicted for Kill Switch Code Activated Upon His Termination ( Read Paper ) A former software developer faces up to 10 years in prison after deploying malicious code that sabotaged his employers systems, causing global disruptions and financial losses. Davis Lu, 55, was convicted by a jury for intentionally damaging protected computers at Eaton Corp., where he had worked for 11 years. Prosecutors revealed that Lu embedded destructive scripts to crash systems, delete user profiles, and prevent loginsculminating in a kill switch that shut down operations on the day of his termination. Key Points Sabotage uncovered: Eaton Corp. identified the malicious code while investigating system crashes, tracing it back to Lus user ID and a restricted server only he could access. Deliberate obstruction: Evidence from Lus search history revealed he had researched ways to escalate privileges, hide processes, and delete files, suggesting an intent to prevent colleagues from restoring the network. Legal battle ahead: Lu admitted to writing some of the code but maintains his innocence. His attorney announced plans to appeal, while the DOJ has yet to set a sentencing date. As an Engineer, Id Rather Be Called Stupid Than Stay Silent (Read Paper ) Asking stupid questions isnt a weaknessits a superpower. In high-pressure situations, like responding to incidents or troubleshooting complex systems, its easy to hesitate before asking for clarification. What if everyone else understands, and youre the only one left in the dark? That fear keeps many from speaking up, but the truth is: embracing vulnerability accelerates learning. By daring to ask, you not only grow your own knowledge but also contribute to a culture where curiosity and collaboration thrive. Key Points Fear of looking clueless: Many professionals hesitate to ask questions, fearing theyll seem incompetent. But staying silent can lead to bigger mistakes, delays, and missed opportunities for growth. The power of vulnerability: By admitting what they dont know, teams foster a culture of trust and shared learning. A blameless environment encourages open discussions, making problem-solving more efficient. Forcing AI on Developers Is a Bad Idea That Is Going to Happen ( Read Paper) Companies have a long history of introducing new features that users never asked for, often making their experience worse. This phenomenon is so common that it deserves a nameperhaps JetBrains Syndrome, in honor of the latest example. JetBrains has integrated a non-removable AI Assistant into its IDEs, creating an immediate headache for developers who work under strict no-AI policies. The problem isnt the AI itself but the lack of choice: when software dictates how and when users interact with new tools, frustration is inevitable. Key Points Feature creep turns toxic: The introduction of unremovable AI in JetBrains IDEs disrupts workflows, forcing developers to engage with a tool they might not want or be allowed to use. Worse, it puts professionals in an awkward position, having to justify its presence to management. AI isnt going away, but how we handle it matters: Instead of forcing adoption, companies should focus on transparency, clear policies, and user-driven implementation. If AI assistance is truly valuable, developers will embrace iton their own terms. Popular Github Action Tj-Actions/Changed-Files Is Compromised ( Read Paper ) A widely used GitHub Action, tj-actions/changed-files, has been compromised, potentially exposing secrets in thousands of CI pipelines. The malicious payload attempted to dump credentials, but the compromised gist used in the attack has since been removed. GitHub has released an advisory, and the maintainers have reverted affected tags and published a fixed version (v46.0.1). Developers must take immediate action to assess exposure and mitigate risks. Key Points Identify affected repositories: Search for tj-actions in your codebase using GitHub's search query or a Semgrep rule to locate impacted workflows. Any usage of the compromised commit (0e58ed8...) or affected tags should be reviewed and removed. Mitigate the risk: Rotate any exposed secrets, update CI pipelines to use the latest safe commit (2f7c5bf...), and consider using immutable commit SHAs instead of version tags to prevent future incidents. Audit past workflow runs: Review logs for suspicious activity, especially outbound network requests, and prioritize repositories where CI logs are public. Organizations should also configure GitHub settings to prevent unauthorized GitHub Actions from executing. And that's a wrap. Stay tuned for the latest tech news and updates!"

"PurrCrypt, the Cutest Way to Secure Your Secrets","View this post on the web at Welcome to HackerPulse Dispatch! This week, were exploring the latest tech buzz, from reimagining hash tables to reviving an IBM PS/1 for the ultimate DOOM benchmark. Plus, weve got updates on the High Court ruling for a gardeners 1M jackpot and a quirky encryption tool that turns your secrets into adorable kitty and puppy speak! Heres what new: Undergraduate Upends a 40-Year-Old Data Science Conjecture: A discovery challenges a 40-year-old assumption about hash tables, introducing a dramatically faster way to organize and retrieve data. Why Fastdoom Is Fast: A deep dive into restoring an IBM PS/1 486-DX2 and optimizing DOOM's performance with fastDOOM, revealing significant speed improvements through historical code analysis and benchmark testing. Gardener Wins Case Against Paddy Power Over 1M Prize: A High Court judge ruled that a gardener is entitled to her full 1M jackpot from Paddy Power after the company claimed a computer error had incorrectly displayed her winnings. A Quick Journey Into the Linux Kernel: Linux kernel development revolves around its modular structure, efficient process handling, flexible file systems, robust networking stack, advanced memory management, extensible driver support, rapid open-source iteration, and powerful debugging tools. vxfemboy/purrcrypt : PurrCrypt combines cryptographic security with adorable pet speak, turning your encrypted messages into cute cat and dog sounds while keeping your secrets safe! Undergraduate Upends a 40-Year-Old Data Science Conjecture ( Read Paper ) Andrew Krapivin, a Rutgers undergraduate in 2021, stumbled upon a research paper that seemed unremarkable at first. Two years later, reading it just for fun led him to rethink a fundamental tool in computer science: hash tables. His breakthrough challenged a 40-year-old conjecture, catching the attention of researchers who initially met his claims with skepticism. But after rigorous analysis, Krapivin and his collaborators not only disproved the long-standing assumption but also introduced a dramatically faster method for organizing and retrieving data. Key Points Breaking a 40-year-old belief: Krapivins discovery disproves Andrew Yaos 1985 conjecture, which set a speed limit on how quickly elements could be found in certain hash tables. His approach reduces worst-case search times from x to (log x). Faster than anyone thought possible: The teams findings also challenge the assumed average query time for hash tables. Instead of being tied to the tables fullness, they demonstrated a constant search time. No immediate applicationsbut big potential: While practical uses arent obvious yet, experts say these results deepen our understanding of hash tables, a core component of computing. Why Fastdoom Is Fast ( Read Paper ) Restoring an IBM PS/1 486-DX2 66MHz was more than a nostalgic projectit was a long-awaited dream finally realized. With the machine up and running, the first order of business was to test DOOMs performance using the legendary timedemo benchmark. But what started as a simple performance check quickly turned into a deep dive into fastDOOM, an optimized port that significantly boosted FPS without sacrificing authenticity. This journey led to an exhaustive analysis of its evolution, from early optimization patches to cutting-edge assembly-level tweaks. The result? A newfound appreciation for both the constraints of early 90s game development and the ingenuity of modern retrocomputing efforts. Key Points Benchmarking nostalgia: Running DOOM on a restored IBM PS/1 revealed that the original game engine had untapped performance potential, with fastDOOM boosting FPS by up to 48%. Reverse engineering history: Tracing fastDOOMs development involved analyzing over 3,000 commits, uncovering key optimizations such as inlining calculations and removing redundant rendering operations. Mode Y vs. mode 13h: The choice between these VGA modes played a crucial role in DOOMs performance, with mode Y enabling triple buffering for efficiency, while mode 13h provided advantages for faster CPUs and PCI video cards. Gardener Wins Case Against Paddy Power Over 1M Prize ( Read Paper ) A Gloucestershire gardener who was denied her 1,097,132 jackpot from an online game has won her case against Paddy Power, with a judge ruling she is entitled to the full sum. Corrine Durber sued the gambling giant after it claimed a computer error had incorrectly displayed her winnings and only paid her a fraction of the amount. The court found that customers should expect the on-screen results to be accurate, dismissing Paddy Powers defense. Following the ruling, Mrs. Durber expressed relief, stating the money would change her familys life, while Paddy Power said it regrets the situation and is reviewing the judgment. Key Points Court backs 'what you see is what you get': Justice Ritchie ruled that customers reasonably expect displayed game results to be accurate, likening it to a physical casino payout. Paddy Powers software failure exposed: The court found a programming error affected 14 plays over 48 days, leading to incorrect jackpot displays. Durber vows never to bet with Paddy Power again: Grateful for her legal victory, she criticized the company for forcing her into a prolonged legal battle instead of paying her winnings immediately. A Quick Journey Into the Linux Kernel ( Read Paper ) Revisiting operating systems coursework can sometimes feel like wading through abstract theory, detached from real-world application. Concepts like process scheduling and memory management make sense in textbooks but remain difficult to visualize in action. Thats why Robert Loves Linux Kernel Development was a game-changer. Though it covers the aging 2.6 kernel, the book still provides an insightful foundation into Linuxs core principles. Diving deeper into modern kernel code revealed that while APIs and implementations evolve, fundamental design philosophies remain steady. Key Points Processes in Linux: No distinction between processes and threadseverything is a taskstruct. System calls tweak resource sharing, and zombie processes linger until the parent collects the exit status. Scheduling and fairness: The Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) uses virtual runtime and a red-black tree to ensure fair CPU allocation based on priority. Kernel-space programming: No standard C library, a fixed stack, and strict constraints. Synchronization tools like spinlocks and mutexes prevent race conditions. vxfemboy /purrcrypt ( Read Paper ) Get ready to meet the purr-fect way to keep your secrets safe with PurrCrypt a crypto tool wrapped in the cutest disguise. Think of it as your cat or dog sending you encrypted messages, but with serious security under all the fluff. Powered by elliptic curve cryptography like Bitcoin, it ensures your secrets are locked up tight, even if they look like random pet sounds! Key Points The furry encryption tool: PurrCrypt is built for cryptography lovers who also enjoy a good cat video. It turns your messages into adorable pet speak while using strong elliptic curve encryptionso secure, even the NSA would say aww and walk away. User-friendly (and pet-approved): Install and use this tool just like setting up a new pet toy! Encrypt messages with ease, choose your pet's dialect (cat or dog), and keep your secrets hidden behind furry paws. Not just for fun It's Secure: Despite the cute disguises, the security is real. PurrCrypt uses the same cryptographic principles as Bitcoin, and your messages can only be decoded with the right key. Even your pets can't spill the secrets! And that's a wrap!

"Self-Improving LLMs, Full-Song Generation, and Smarter Uncertainty","View this post on the web at Welcome to this weeks AI Fridays, where we explore breakthroughs in self-improving models, uncertainty estimation, and AI-generated music. Discover four cognitive behaviors that enhance reasoning, LADDERs recursive problem-solving approach, and how entropy predicts when LLMs doubt their own answers. Plus, experience DiffRhythms full-length song generation in seconds and SemViQAs cutting-edge fact-checking system for Vietnamese news. Heres whats new: Self-Improving LLMs: Four cognitive behaviors that boost reasoning and reinforcement learning. DiffRhythm: Generating full-length, high-quality songs with AI in just ten seconds. SemViQA: Advancing Vietnamese fact-checking with fast, semantic-based evidence retrieval. LLM Uncertainty: When AI hesitatesentropy-based predictions for knowledge vs. reasoning tasks. LADDER: Recursive decomposition boosts a small models math accuracy from 1% to 82%. Cognitive Behaviors that Enable Self-Improving Reasoners, or, Four Habits of Highly Effective STaRs ( Read the Paper ) The study identifies four crucial cognitive behaviors (verification, backtracking, subgoal setting, and backward chaining) that enable language models to effectively self-improve through reinforcement learning, demonstrating that models which naturally exhibit or are primed with these behaviors can achieve superior performance regardless of initial solution accuracy. DiffRhythm: Blazingly Fast and Embarrassingly Simple End-to-End Full-Length Song Generation with Latent Diffusion ( Read the Paper ) DiffRhythm introduces the first latent diffusion-based model capable of generating complete, high-quality songs (up to 4m45s) with both vocals and accompaniment in just ten seconds, utilizing a remarkably simple architecture that requires only lyrics and style prompts while eliminating the need for complex data preparation or multi-stage pipelines. SemViQA: A Semantic Question Answering System for Vietnamese Information Fact-Checking ( Read the Paper ) SemViQA introduces a state-of-the-art Vietnamese fact-checking framework that combines Semantic-based Evidence Retrieval and Two-step Verdict Classification, achieving leading accuracy scores (78.97-80.82%) while offering a 7x faster variant, advancing automated fact-verification capabilities for low-resource languages. When an LLM is apprehensive about its answers -- and when its uncertainty is justified ( Read the Paper ) Token-wise entropy effectively predicts LLM errors in knowledge-based tasks (ROC AUC 0.73 for biology) but not in reasoning-heavy domains (ROC AUC 0.55 for math), suggesting uncertainty estimation frameworks should incorporate data uncertainty while current model-as-judge approaches need improvement. LADDER: Self-Improving LLMs Through Recursive Problem Decomposition ( Read the Paper ) LADDER enables language models to autonomously improve their problem-solving abilities by recursively generating and solving simpler variants of complex problems, demonstrating remarkable results on mathematical integration tasks where it boosted a Llama 3B model's accuracy from 1% to 82% and achieved state-of-the-art performance on MIT Integration Bee problems through self-directed learning.

"Git Settings That Should Be Default, Microsofts .NET 10 & Devlands for Navigating Git","View this post on the web at Welcome to HackerPulse Dispatch! Were exploring the hottest topics in tech, from EA embracing open source for fan-driven improvements and preservation, to essential Git config settings that shouldve been defaults ages ago. Plus, were looking into C creator pushing back as Rust gains ground in memory safety battle, a gamified approach to mastering Git in Devlands, and all the exciting updates coming with Microsoft's .NET 10. Heres what new: EA Just Open Sourced Command & Conquer, Red Alert, Renegade and Generals: EA open-sourced several classic Command & Conquer games under GPL3, added Steam Workshop support, and released rare early development footage. How Core Git Developers Configure Git: Some git config settings should be defaults by now discover the ones even Git core devs change for a better experience. I Struggled With Git, so Im Making a Game to Spare Others the Pain: The Git-Sim creator introduces Devlandsan immersive, voxel-based environment, designed to make learning and using Git more intuitive and engaging. Microsofts .Net 10 Arrives in First Preview: Microsoft's .NET 10 Preview introduces major updates across runtime, SDK, libraries, and languages, enhancing performance, developer flexibility, and productivity, with a production release expected in November. EA Just Open Sourced Command & Conquer, Red Alert, Renegade & Generals ( Read Paper ) Its not every day that a major game publisher decides to open-source some of its most iconic titles, but thats exactly what EA has done with Command & Conquer, Red Alert, C&C Renegade, and C&C Generals (including Zero Hour). These games are now officially available under the GPL3 license, with some restrictions, such as limitations on trademark use. This move allows the community to not only preserve these classics but also learn from and potentially improve them. Alongside the open-sourcing, EA has added Steam Workshop support for multiple C&C games, making it easier than ever for fans to create and share mods. To top it off, theyve released never-before-seen gameplay footage from the early development of C&C Renegade and C&C Generals. Key Points Open source, with a catch: The games are licensed under GPL3, but EA has placed restrictions on trademark use, meaning ""Command & Conquer"" and related branding cant be freely used. Steam Workshop support expands: EA has enabled Steam Workshop for multiple C&C titles, including C&C Renegade, C&C Generals & Zero Hour, and Red Alert 3. A look into the past: EA has released rare development footage of C&C Renegade and C&C Generals, providing a fascinating glimpse into how these classics were made. How Core Git Developers Configure Git ( Read Paper ) Some Git settings should really be defaults by nowafter all, even Git's core developers configure them this way. From improving diffs to making fetch and push commands behave more intuitively, these tweaks make Git smoother to use. In fact, a few years ago, Git developers ran a ""Spring Cleaning"" experiment to see which settings they couldnt live without, and the results were eye-opening. Heres a look at some of the best Git config changes you should make today. Key Points Better defaults for branches and sorting: Sorting branches by recent commits (branch.sort-committerdate) and tags by version (tag.sortversion:refname) makes Git's output more useful. Setting init.defaultBranchmain prevents Git from nagging when initializing new repos. Smarter diffs and conflict handling: Using diff.algorithmhistogram results in clearer diffs, and enabling diff.colorMovedplain highlights moved code. Enabling merge.conflictstylezdiff3 improves merge conflict readability. Easier pushing and fetching: push.autoSetupRemotetrue saves you from manually setting upstream branches, while fetch.prunetrue and fetch.pruneTagstrue keep your repo clean by removing deleted branches and tags. Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C, urged the programming community to take action as cybersecurity agencies and tech firms increasingly favor memory-safe languages like Rust. With government mandates pushing for a transition away from C and C, concerns about security vulnerabilities have intensified, putting pressure on the standards body to respond. Stroustrup's proposed solution, Profiles, aims to enhance safety without abandoning C entirely, but doubts remain about its viability before 2026. Meanwhile, alternative approaches like TrapC and other memory-safe C initiatives are gaining traction as potential lifelines for the language. Key Points Government pressure mounts: Agencies like CISA are calling for a roadmap to eliminate memory safety vulnerabilities by 2026, putting C and C on notice while promoting Rust and other safer alternatives. Stroustrup's call to action: In a note to the C standards committee, he warns that C is under ""serious attack"" and advocates for a structured approach to improving memory safety while preserving the language. Skepticism about solutions: While Stroustrups Profiles framework aims to enforce safety through compiler restrictions, critics argue it wont be ready in timemeanwhile, projects like TrapC and DARPAs TRACTOR push for automated solutions to modernize existing C/C code. I Struggled With Git, so Im Making a Game to Spare Others the Pain ( Read Paper ) Enter Devlands, a voxel-based world where developers can literally walk through their repositories, interact with Git concepts, and even get AI-assisted explanations. Inspired by game environments, Devlands turns Git from an abstract tool into something users can see, touch, and explore. Key Points From Git-Sim to Devlands: While Git-Sim visualized Git commands, Devlands creates an immersive world where branches become hallways, commits become rooms, and Git interactions feel physical and intuitive. Gamifying Git with a voxel world: After experimenting with a Doom-like interface, the project shifted to a calmer, block-based environment inspired by voxel games. The result is an interactive world where developers can stage, commit, and merge using real Git commands in a visually structured way. Making Git more relatable: Devlands transforms Git from a complex tool into something tangible, bridging the gap for new developers. Microsofts .Net 10 Arrives in First Preview ( Read Paper ) Microsoft has released the first preview of .NET 10, introducing significant updates across the runtime, SDK, libraries, and languages like C 14 and F. The production release is expected in November, bringing improvements to ASP.NET Core, Blazor, .NET MAUI, and more. Enhancements focus on performance, language flexibility, and developer productivity. Key additions include new compiler optimizations, API improvements, and expanded support for OpenAPI and Entity Framework. Key Points C 14 enhancements: The latest version introduces first-class support for System.Span and System.ReadOnlySpan , improving performance without sacrificing safety. It also allows more flexible parameter modifiers in lambda expressions and supports unbound generic types in nameof. Runtime and library improvements: The JIT compiler now de-virtualizes method calls for array interfaces and optimizes stack allocation of small value-type arrays. New APIs extend normalization beyond strings and improve performance for ZipArchive operations. Better tooling and frameworks: ASP.NET Core gains OpenAPI 3.1 support, Blazor now highlights route syntax, and Entity Framework introduces first-class LINQ support for LeftJoin. .NET MAUI ships as a workload and NuGet package, making version management easier for developers. And that's a wrap! Stay tuned for your weekly dose of tech news."

"Faster Attention, Arabic OCR, and Smarter Multimodal Models","View this post on the web at Welcome to this weeks AI Fridays, where we explore new frontiers in efficiency, OCR, and multimodal reasoning. FFTNet replaces self-attention with a Fast Fourier Transform-based alternative, KITAB-Bench sets a new standard for Arabic OCR, and COD predicts LLM performance with clustering. Meanwhile, Visual Perception Tokens enhance multimodal understanding, and Stable-SPAM stabilizes 4-bit model training beyond 16-bit Adams capabilities. Heres whats new: FFTNet: Fast Fourier Transform-based token mixing rivals self-attention with O(n log n) efficiency. KITAB-Bench: The first comprehensive Arabic OCR benchmark, revealing gaps in text recognition. COD Scaling: Predicting LLM performance via difficulty-based clustering with 1.36% mean deviation. Visual Perception Tokens: Improving spatial reasoning and visual tasks by 23.6% with efficient multimodal control. Stable-SPAM: Enabling 4-bit training to outperform 16-bit Adam while using 4x less memory. The FFT Strikes Back: An Efficient Alternative to Self-Attention ( Read the Paper ) FFTNet introduces an efficient alternative to self-attention by leveraging Fast Fourier Transform for global token mixing, achieving O(n log n) complexity while maintaining or exceeding standard attention performance through adaptive spectral filtering in the frequency domain. KITAB-Bench: A Comprehensive Multi-Domain Benchmark for Arabic OCR and Document Understanding ( Read the Paper ) KITAB-Bench introduces the first comprehensive Arabic OCR benchmark with 8,809 samples across 9 domains, revealing that modern vision-language models outperform traditional OCR approaches by 60% in Character Error Rate while highlighting critical limitations in Arabic text recognition, particularly in PDF-to-Markdown conversion where even top models achieve only 65% accuracy. Unveiling Downstream Performance Scaling of LLMs: A Clustering-Based Perspective ( Read the Story ) COD (Clustering-On-Difficulty) enables accurate prediction of large language model performance on downstream tasks by strategically clustering tasks based on difficulty features and using smaller models' performance on predictable subsets to extrapolate full-scale capabilities, achieving 1.36% mean deviation across benchmarks. Introducing Visual Perception Token into Multimodal Large Language Model ( Read the Story ) This work introduces Visual Perception Tokens that enable multimodal language models to autonomously control their visual perception processes through region selection and re-encoding mechanisms, resulting in a 23.6% performance improvement in spatial reasoning and fine-grained visual understanding tasks while using fewer parameters than larger models. Stable-SPAM: How to Train in 4-Bit More Stably than 16-Bit Adam ( Read the Story ) Stable-SPAM introduces an enhanced optimizer that enables more stable 4-bit model training through adaptive gradient clipping and normalization, demonstrating superior performance to 16-bit Adam while using 4x less memory and requiring half the training steps to achieve equivalent results. And that's a wrap! Stick around for your weekly roundup of all things AI, with the latest trends and insights you wont want to miss."

OpenAI Reveals AIs No Match for Human Coders,"View this post on the web at Welcome to HackerPulse Dispatch! Were delving into the most buzzworthy topics in tech, including the growing challenge of AI-generated code piling on technical debt, Googles Rust-backed push to secure Android, and OpenAIs latest findings showing how AI still falls short of human coders. Heres what new: Googles Shift to Rust Programming Cuts Android Memory Vulnerabilities by 68%: By prioritizing Rust, Google has reduced Androids memory safety vulnerabilities from 76% to 24% over six years. OpenAI Researchers Find That Even the Best AI Is Unable to Solve the Majority of Coding Problems: OpenAIs research shows that AI models struggle with real-world coding tasks, often failing to diagnose bugs or provide reliable solutions. I Am Glad AI Didnt Exist When I Learned to Code: While AI-powered tools like Cursor make coding faster and easier, they also risk removing crucial learning experiences that come from debugging and experimenting with code. How AI Generated Code Compounds Technical Debt: GitClear's report reveals that while AI-driven coding assistants increase productivity, they also contribute to rising code duplication, declining maintainability, and growing technical debt. XOR: Discover the timeless utility of XOR, exploring its critical role in boolean logic, CPU optimization, and even game theory, proving that this simple operator still packs a powerful punch in modern programming. Googles Shift to Rust Programming Cuts Android Memory Vulnerabilities by 68% ( Read Paper ) Google's push toward memory-safe languages like Rust is paying off, with the percentage of memory safety vulnerabilities in Android dropping from 76% to 24% over six years. By prioritizing secure-by-design principles, the company has made Safe Coding a scalable and cost-effective strategy for reducing security risks. Interestingly, vulnerabilities tend to decline even as the amount of memory-unsafe code grows, thanks to the exponential decay of security flaws over time. This shift has led to a drastic reduction in Android vulnerabilities, with numbers falling from 223 in 2019 to fewer than 50 in 2024. Rather than full rewrites, Google is taking a more incremental approach by improving interoperability between Rust, C, and Kotlin to phase out entire vulnerability classes. Key Points The paradox of security flaws: Vulnerabilities decay exponentially, meaning the majority of security risks come from newly written or modified code. As older code matures, it naturally becomes safer, diminishing the need for major rewrites and shifting the focus toward proactive security measures. Safe coding as a paradigm shift: Google's move toward Safe Coding allows for stronger security assertions, moving beyond reactive patching toward high-assurance prevention. By turning off the tap of new vulnerabilities, the effectiveness of security measures increases while scalability challenges decrease. Collaborating on GPU security: Google and Arm have been working together to enhance the security of the GPU software and firmware stack within Android. This effort has led to the discovery and resolution of several vulnerabilities, reinforcing proactive testing as a critical defense strategy. OpenAI Researchers Find That Even the Best AI Is Unable to Solve the Majority of Coding Problems ( Read Paper ) OpenAI researchers have admitted that even the most advanced AI models still struggle with real-world coding tasks, despite CEO Sam Altmans claim that they will surpass low-level software engineers by the end of the year. In a new study, OpenAI tested its flagship GPT-4o, the o1 reasoning model, and Anthropics Claude 3.5 Sonnet using a benchmark built from 1,400 Upwork software engineering tasks. While the models worked faster than humans, they failed to diagnose bugs in larger projects or provide reliable solutions. The research highlights that AI models, while improving, still lack the contextual understanding and reliability needed for real-world software development. Key Points Speed vs. accuracy trade-off: While AI models completed tasks quickly, they frequently misunderstood the broader context of bugs, leading to incorrect or overly simplistic solutions. This reinforces a common issue with AI-generated codeit often appears convincing but falls apart under scrutiny. AI models still lack reliability: Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperformed OpenAIs models, earning more money on Upwork tasks, but its answers were still mostly incorrect. The study concludes that current models need significantly higher reliability before they can be trusted with real-world software engineering work. Hype vs. reality in AI coding: Despite rapid advancements, AI remains incapable of replacing human software engineers for complex tasks. However, this hasnt stopped some companies from cutting engineering teams in favor of AI, despite the clear limitations highlighted by OpenAIs own research. Im Glad AI Didnt Exist When I Learned to Code ( Read Paper ) AI-powered developer tools have made coding easier than ever, but they come with a tradeoffone that might change how future programmers learn. A self-taught high school coder reflects on their journey from debugging syntax errors manually to using AI assistants like Cursor for instant fixes. While todays AI can streamline development, it also removes the struggle that once led to deeper understanding. Without experimenting and troubleshooting, new coders may lose the chance to internalize fundamental programming principles. Key Points The AI learning dilemma: AI-assisted coding makes debugging effortless, but that ease can stunt learning. If todays AI tools had existed years ago, many developers might have missed out on key problem-solving skills. Speed vs. understanding: The shift from manually fixing errors to AI-driven solutions means new programmers may skip crucial learning experiences. While AI speeds up development, it also removes the need to deeply engage with code. Finding balance with AI: Even AI-reliant coders recognize the value of manual coding. Some still choose to write low-level code in environments like Neovim to maintain their skills and understanding. How AI Generated Code Compounds Technical Debt ( Read Paper ) The rise of AI-driven coding tools has brought about a wave of productivity in software development, but it comes with unintended consequences. GitClears latest report highlights how the widespread use of AI in code generation is leading to troubling increases in code duplication and a decline in overall quality. As AI tools continue to evolve, the temptation to quickly generate code without rethinking core principles, like reusability, is increasing. Key Points The rise of redundant code: GitClears report shows an 8-fold increase in code duplication, a trend that's showing no signs of slowing down. This goes against best practices like the DRY principle and highlights a growing issue in code quality. The hidden cost of AI-generated code: While AI-driven tools promise efficiency, they come with a long-term maintenance burden. The increase in copy-pasted code could lead to more bugs, higher storage costs, and more time spent debugging and fixing issues. XOR ( Read Paper ) The article explores the multifaceted world of XORan operation that once played a critical role in computer systems and continues to hold unique value in programming today. Although its relevance may have waned for some developers, XOR remains a cornerstone of boolean logic, error-checking, and efficient bit manipulation. From its beginnings as a simple operator in digital circuits to its surprising applications in minimalistic CPUs and game theory, XOR is a versatile tool that every programmer can benefit from understanding. Key Points XOR in Boolean logic: XOR operates on two bits to produce an output of 1 if the bits differ, and 0 if they are the same. This fundamental behavior is integral to boolean logic and serves as the basis for various digital systems and error-checking techniques. XOR as a substitute in CPU operations: In the 1970s, when Data Generals CPU lacked a bitwise XOR operation, it was cleverly implemented using the half-adder identity. This allowed XOR to be derived from other operations like addition and AND, showcasing its utility in CPUs with minimal instruction sets. Swapping bits and game theory with XOR: XOR can efficiently swap bits with minimal computational cost, making it a valuable tool in tasks like bit manipulation. Additionally, it plays a key role in game theory, particularly in the game of Nim, where players use XOR to determine the best strategy for winning. And that's a wrap! Stick around for your weekly roundup of all things tech, with the latest trends and insights you wont want to miss."

GenAI Isnt Replacing Devs (And It Shouldnt),"View this post on the web at Welcome to HackerPulse Dispatch! In this edition, were exploring some of the hottest topics in tech, from why replacing programmers with AI might just be the biggest mistake you can make, to the fascinating journey behind the greatest calculator app development story. Well also discuss the upcoming performance boost in Python 3.14 and share insights from the Anthropic Research Fellowship interview. Heres what new: A Calculator App? Anyone Could Make That.: Androids calculator isnt just accurateits a feat of engineering that solved the fundamental limitations of floating-point math. Techs Dumbest Mistake: Why Firing Programmers for AI Will Destroy Everything: Tech companies betting on AI to replace programmers will soon face a talent crisis, broken systems, and skyrocketing costs to rehire the very engineers they let go. No, Your GenAI Model Isnt Going to Replace Me: A seasoned contractor identified critical performance bottlenecks missed by automated tests, proving that intuition, expertise, and hands-on problem-solving remain irreplaceable in software engineering. I Failed My Anthropic Interview and Came to Tell You All About It So You Dont Have To: Anthropics research fellowship interview process pushes candidates to demonstrate coding skills, creativity, and cultural fit through a series of high-pressure challenges, from automated coding tests to brainstorming sessions. A New Interpreter in Python 3.14 Delivers a Free Speed Boost: Python 3.14 introduces a new interpreter that enhances performance by up to 30% with no modifications needed to existing code or C extension modules. A Calculator App? Anyone Could Make That.( Read Paper ) Making a calculator that consistently delivers precise answers is a monumental challenge. The iOS calculator famously fails simple expressions like (10100)1(10100)(10100) 1 - (10100)(10100)1(10100), while Android gets it rightthanks to Hans-J. Boehm, the legendary engineer behind Google's garbage collection efforts. Tasked with building the perfect calculator, Boehm had to navigate floating-point precision errors, algebraic arithmetic, and even the limits of real number representation. What followed was an engineering odyssey involving bignums, constructive real arithmetic, and a groundbreaking hybrid approach that balanced speed with correctness. Key Points The floating-point problem: Standard floating-point numbers cant represent values like 101001010010100 or even simple fractions like 0.3, making precise calculations impossible. To fix this, Boehms team started using bignumsarbitrarily large integersbut that only solved part of the problem. Going deeper with real numbers: The team explored algebraic numbers (like 2sqrt22) and eventually constructive real arithmetic (RRA). This allowed Androids calculator to handle expressions involving pi and other irrationals correctly. The final breakthrough: Instead of relying entirely on RRA, which struggles with equality checks, Boehms team combined rational arithmetic with symbolic representations of key values like pi and 2sqrt22. Techs Dumbest Mistake: Why Firing Programmers for AI Will Destroy Everything ( Read Paper ) The tech industry has a short memory. Not long ago, programmers were revered as architects of the digital world. Now, theyre seen as outdated and expensive, with AI positioned as the ultimate replacement. But as companies rush to cut engineering teams, history warns that this strategy is a ticking time bomb. The fallout will be brutal: undertrained junior devs, chaotic AI-generated code, and a hiring crisis for skilled engineers. Key Points A lost generation of programmers: By sidelining junior developers, companies are creating a talent vacuum. Without real-world problem-solving experience, the next wave of engineers will be little more than AI prompt jockeys. AI cant fix its own mess: Companies laying off engineers will soon realize AI-generated code is a liability. Security flaws, maintenance nightmares, and compliance disasters will send them scrambling to rehire the very programmers they dismissed. Elite programmers will be pricier than ever: As skilled engineers become rarer, demand will drive salaries sky-high. The few who truly understand systems will name their price, and desperate companies will have no choice but to pay up. No, Your GenAI Model Isnt Going to Replace Me ( Read Paper ) In the past three weeks, a seasoned contractor identified and resolved critical performance issues that potentially saved the company hundreds of thousands of dollars. Despite having no bonuses to show for it, the satisfaction of solving complex technical problems was its own reward. His deep-rooted experience and intuition led him to suspect a system bottleneck, even though all standard tests passed without issue. Through rigorous analysis with VisualVM, custom test scenarios, and precise debugging, he pinpointed two unsuspecting lines of code among thousands. The result? A staggering 10x increase in throughput, boosting developer productivity and earning well-deserved recognition. Key Points Beyond standard testing: The performance issues werent traditional bugs; all tests passed. However, experience-driven intuition and deep system profiling uncovered inefficiencies that traditional code reviews missed. The limits of AI in software development: Despite advancements in GenAI, it lacks the human intuition, creativity, and problem-solving skills honed through years of hands-on experience. The belief that AI can replace mid-level engineers entirely by 2025 raises concerns about the future of software development. A call to young developers: While AI tools may generate code, true expertise comes from learning, thinking, and writing code independently. The best developers leverage their humanity, intuition, and creativitytraits that no machine can replicate. I Failed My Anthropic Interview & Came to Tell You All About It So You Dont Have To ( Read Paper ) Anthropic, the company behind Claude, is creating waves with its powerful AI models and a research fellowship program that stands out in the tech world. With backing from Amazon and a focus on safety, their selection process is rigorous and designed to assess more than just coding skills. The interview process is split into multiple stages, each testing different aspects of a candidates abilities, from coding to creativity to cultural fit. Key Points Stage 1: Online Coding (1.5 hours): Candidates are required to build a class with a public API under tight time constraints, emphasizing speed over optimization. The challenge is impersonal and automated, demanding raw coding execution over fancy algorithms. Stage 2: Face-to-Face Coding (1 hour): A LeetCode-style problem is presented with a twist, testing problem-solving ability in a more traditional format. Preparation through typical coding platforms like LeetCode is recommended. Stage 3: Virtual Onsite (Three Parts): This stage includes a research brainstorm, a take-home assignment, and a culture fit session. The most unique part is the research brainstorm, where candidates must generate creative ideas on the spot, a challenging task that tests adaptability and creativity under pressure. A New Interpreter in Python 3.14 Delivers a Free Speed Boost ( Read Paper ) Python 3.14, set for release later this year, is introducing a major update to its interpreter that could boost performance by up to 30%, all while ensuring complete compatibility with existing code. This improvement stems from a new optimization based on tail calls, a concept previously unfamiliar to most Python developers. Crucially, this change will require no modifications to Python code or C extension modules, making it a seamless performance upgrade for many. However, devs building from source will need to enable the feature manually, and certain C compilers are required for support. Key Points Tail call-based interpreter: The new interpreter, leveraging tail call optimization at the C compiler level, boosts performance without altering existing code. No changes needed for compatibility: Python code and C extension modules dont need to be updated, reducing maintenance overhead for developers. Compilation requirements: For those building from source, the feature requires a C compiler that supports tail call optimization, such as MSVC or Clang 19. And that's a wrap! Stay tuned for your weekly dose of tech news and insights."

The Hidden Cost of Context Switching,"View this post on the web at Welcome to HackerPulse Dispatch! In this edition, we delve into the latest tech trends, exploring everything from IEEE-754 compliance and smarter networking for Linux to the growing impact of AI in software development. We also tackle the hidden productivity cost of context switching for devs and the legal battle over JavaScript trademark. Heres what new: Elementary Functions and NOT Following the IEEE 754 Floating-Point Standard: Despite IEEE-754 requiring correct rounding, most major math libraries fail to comply, leading to inconsistencies that can impact applications from neural networks to multiplayer gaming. Linux Kernel Tweak Could Cut Data Center Power Usage by up to 30%: A new Linux kernel update dynamically optimizes network traffic handling, improving data center performance while reducing power consumption by up to 30%. Context-Switching Is the Main Productivity Killer for Developers: Frequent interruptions and context-switching significantly reduce developer productivity, leading to increased errors, longer task completion times, and higher technical debt. Sawyer-Powell/Chatgcc: Chatgcc leverages ChatGPT to generate and assemble C code into executable files, offering a humorous yet thought-provoking look at AIs potential in software development. Oracle Justified Its JavaScript Trademark With Node.jsNow It Wants That Ignored: Oracle is using legal tactics to delay Denos petition to cancel its ""JavaScript"" trademark, despite having no meaningful involvement in the language's development. Elementary Functions and NOT Following the IEEE 754 Floating-Point Standard ( Read Paper ) IEEE 754, the gold standard for floating-point arithmetic, has been shaping numerical computing since 1985. Despite revisions in 2008 and 2019 that demand correctly rounded results, major math libraries still fall short. Recent research into sine function implementations reveals inconsistencies in rounding, showing that even widely used software doesnt meet the latest IEEE standards. This has real-world implications, from game development to machine learning, where deterministic calculations matter. Key Points Rounding inconsistencies: Tests on Microsoft's C library and Julia's implementation of sin reveal different rounding errors, creating a side-channel effect that exposes which library an application is using. Industry response: Engineers acknowledge the issue but often dismiss it, citing performance concerns. Some argue that strict adherence to IEEE standards would slow down calculations, despite evidence suggesting otherwise. A better approach: By leveraging 64-bit floating-point precision and rounding correctly, an alternative implementation achieves full IEEE compliance without significant performance losschallenging the idea that accurate rounding is impractical. Linux Kernel Tweak Could Cut Data Center Power Usage by up to 30% ( Read Paper ) By fine-tuning CPU usage, this approach promises to enhance application performance while cutting power consumption by up to 30%. The new code, just 30 lines long, has been integrated into Linux 6.13, making it widely available for adoption. Key Points Dynamic traffic handling: The update introduces a new NAPI parameter, irqsuspendtimeout, allowing Linux to automatically switch between polling and interrupt-driven processing based on network load. This ensures optimal efficiency without requiring constant manual tuning. Energy-efficient networking: By disabling interrupts during high traffic and enabling them during low traffic, the system avoids unnecessary CPU usage. This adaptive approach significantly reduces power consumption compared to always-on polling. Seamless integration: The feature requires only minimal configuration changes, making it easy for data centers to adopt. Applications that dominate CPU cores and handle large network loads, such as front-end and back-end servers, stand to benefit the most. Context-Switching Is the Main Productivity Killer for Developers ( Read Paper ) Developers often underestimate how costly interruptions can be, yet research shows that even a brief Slack message can derail productivity for over 20 minutes. Context-switching forces developers to rebuild complex mental models, reducing efficiency and increasing errors. This article explores the cognitive impact of frequent disruptions, why they hit engineers especially hard, and how teams can implement strategies to minimize them. By adopting structured focus time, developers can reduce errors, increase productivity, and maintain a sustainable work pace. Key Points Why interruptions hurt developers more: Programming requires holding multiple concepts in working memory, and even small disruptions can cause a complete reset. Studies show it takes an average of 23 minutes to regain focus after an interruption. The snowball effect of lost productivity: Frequent context-switching doesnt just waste timeit degrades code quality and increases technical debt. Research has linked interruptions to higher bug rates, longer review cycles, and lower maintainability. Sawyer-Powell/ Chatgcc ( Read Paper ) Developers are always looking for unconventional ways to streamline their workflows, and Chatgcc is a prime example of pushing boundariesalbeit in a rather cursed way. Created by Sawyer Powell and Henk Poley, this bash script turns ChatGPT into a C compiler, generating assembly code on the fly and linking it with GCC. While definitely not production-ready (or sanity-friendly), its a fascinating experiment that showcases the potentialand pitfallsof AI-generated code. Key Points How it works: Chatgcc takes a C file and uses ChatGPT to generate x8664 or ARM64 assembly, ensuring platform compatibility on Linux and macOS before attempting to compile it. The script then assembles the AI-generated code with as and links it using gcc. Recent updates: The latest tweaks make it easier to locate the model version by adjusting the order of commands. The project remains experimental, but contributions from developers like Henk Poley have improved its functionality. Why it matters: AI-generated code is a growing field, and projects like Chatgcc highlight both the potential efficiency gains and the inherent risks. While it's not replacing traditional compilers anytime soon, it raises important questions about AI's role in software development. Oracle Justified Its JavaScript Trademark With node.jsNow It Wants That Ignored ( Read Paper ) Oracle has filed a motion to dismiss Denos petition to cancel its ""JavaScript"" trademark, but rather than addressing the core issuethat JavaScript is an open standard with no ties to Oraclethe company is using legal maneuvers to delay the process. This follows years of silence from Oracle after public calls for them to release the trademark, including a petition signed by over 16,000 developers and co-signed by JavaScript's creator, Brendan Eich. Key Points Oracles legal defense: Oracle admits using a screenshot of Node.js in their trademark renewal filing but insists it was only used for a specific class of products and doesnt impact the broader trademark claim. They argue the issue is irrelevant to the core petition, refusing to acknowledge the misrepresentation. Delaying tactics: By filing this motion, Oracle is postponing the real debate about the status of ""JavaScript"" as a trademark, focusing instead on procedural issues. This tactic could extend the case for months, leaving the central matter unresolved. The fundamental issue: JavaScript, defined by ECMA-262 and controlled by the TC39 committee, is a technology built by many, not Oracle. Despite having no involvement in its development, Oracle seeks to retain control over the ""JavaScript"" trademark, a move that raises serious questions about corporate ownership of widely-used standards. And that's a wrap! Stay tuned for next weeks scoop on the latest in tech."

"Smarter Retrieval, Safer RAG, and Autonomous AI","View this post on the web at Welcome to this weeks AI Fridays, where we explore cutting-edge advancements in reasoning, security, and autonomy. Learn how DeepRAG enhances retrieval by dynamically choosing between external knowledge and parametric reasoning, and how Heimas hidden thinking speeds up inference while maintaining accuracy. PRIME optimizes reinforcement learning with implicit rewards, self-play produces state-of-the-art autonomous driving performance, and SafeRAG benchmarks security risks in retrieval-augmented generation systems. Heres whats new: DeepRAG: Step-by-step retrieval reasoning improves accuracy by 22% over traditional RAG methods. Heima: Hidden thinking tokens accelerate Chain-of-Thought reasoning while preserving interpretability. PRIME: Implicit reinforcement rewards boost LLM reasoning performance with minimal training data. Self-Play Autonomy: Gigaflow-trained AI achieves 17.5 years between driving incidents, surpassing human-free benchmarks. SafeRAG: Exposing vulnerabilities in RAG systems through targeted security benchmarking. DeepRAG: Thinking to Retrieval Step by Step for Large Language Models ( Read the Paper ) DeepRAG models retrieval-augmented reasoning as a Markov Decision Process, enabling LLMs to strategically retrieve information by dynamically decomposing queries and deciding when to use external knowledge versus parametric reasoning, resulting in 22% improved answer accuracy compared to traditional RAG approaches. Efficient Reasoning with Hidden Thinking ( Read the Paper ) Heima introduces an efficient reasoning framework that condenses Chain-of-Thought steps into compact hidden representations using a single thinking token, achieving faster generation and better accuracy while maintaining interpretability through a specialized decoder that can reconstruct the full reasoning process. Process Reinforcement through Implicit Rewards ( Read the Paper ) PRIME introduces a novel approach to reinforce language models using implicit process rewards derived from policy rollouts and outcome labels, demonstrating superior performance with 15.1% improvement across reasoning benchmarks while requiring only 10% of traditional training data. Robust Autonomy Emerges from Self-Play ( Read the Paper ) Self-play training in a highly efficient simulator (Gigaflow) produced state-of-the-art autonomous driving performance across multiple benchmarks, achieving 17.5 years between incidents and outperforming previous systems without requiring any human driving data. SafeRAG: Benchmarking Security in Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Large Language Model ( Read the Paper ) This paper introduces SafeRAG, a comprehensive security benchmark that reveals significant vulnerabilities in Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems through systematic testing of various attack scenarios (including silver noise, inter-context conflict, soft ad, and white DoS), demonstrating that even advanced RAG components are susceptible to basic attacks that can degrade service quality. And that's a wrap! Catch you next week with more cutting-edge AI updates."

"The Perks of Being a Full-Stack Dev, Junior Devs Burnout, & JavaScripts Temporal","View this post on the web at Welcome to HackerPulse Dispatch! This edition covers the latest tech trends, from the industry's obsession with all things ""full-stack"" and how to outlast the hype, to the recurring cryptography mistakes that keep haunting devs. We also break down flaws in Oktas authentication system, explore the long-awaited JavaScript Temporal API, and more. Heres what new: Why Junior Developers Are Burning out Before They Bloom: Surviving Techs Obsession With New: AI and automation have made coding faster, but devs risk losing the deep problem-solving skills that separate true experts from copy-paste coders. The Full-Stack Lie: How Chasing Everything Made Developers Worse at Their Jobs: The tech industrys obsession with full-stack devs spreads engineers too thin, but true career success comes from mastering deep, specialized skills. Hell Is Overconfident Developers Writing Encryption Code: Developers keep rolling their own cryptographyoften while insisting they arentwhich leads to the same security failures being repeated endlessly. What Okta Bcrypt Incident Can Teach Us About Designing Better APIs: A flaw in Oktas authentication system allowed users with long usernames to bypass password checks due to Bcrypts 72-character input limit, exposing a critical security oversight. JavaScript Temporal Is Coming: JavaScript's new Temporal object is starting to roll out in experimental browser releases, offering a modern, built-in solution for precise and reliable date and time management. Why Junior Developers Are Burning out Before They Bloom: Surviving Techs Obsession With New( Read Paper ) Developers today have access to AI-powered tools that write code in seconds, but something has been lost along the way. The ability to deeply understand code, debug complex issues, and think independently is fading as automation takes over. Instead of mastering the fundamentals, many developers are stuck in an endless loop of tutorials, frameworks, and updates. The result? More efficiency on the surface but less true problem-solving ability. The solution isnt learning moreits understanding better. Key Points The tutorial treadmill: learning without progress: Junior devs are bombarded with new tools but rarely get the time to master any of them. They know four times as many frameworks as past generations but take three times longer to debug simple issues. The dirty secret tech influencers wont admit: The push to ""stay relevant"" hides an uncomfortable truth: depth beats novelty. A dev who truly understands linux process isolation is more valuable than one who has memorized kubernetes commands without knowing what they do. The unfair advantage nobody talks about: The best devs dont just build appsthey create tools, automation scripts, and reusable components. Instead of chasing trends, they refine foundational skills that stay relevant long after the latest framework fades. The Full-Stack Lie: How Chasing Everything Made Developers Worse at Their Jobs ( Read Paper ) The tech industrys obsession with full-stack devs has created a generation of engineers stretched too thin. Instead of fostering deep expertise, it rewards surface-level knowledge across dozens of tools and frameworks. The result? Developers who can deploy a machine learning model, configure Kubernetes, and build a React frontendjust not very well. True mastery comes from depth, not from juggling endless technologies. Key Points The illusion of versatility: Full-stack development promises adaptability, but often leads to developers who are spread too thin to master anything. The more technologies you ""kind of"" know, the less effective you become at solving real problems. Why companies push the full-stack myth: Businesses push for full-stack engineers to save money, not to build better products. The best developers in historywhether in databases, performance optimization, or securityearned their value through focus, not fragmentation. The power of deep expertise: Specialization leads to leverage, higher salaries, and greater career stability. Instead of chasing every new trend, mastering fundamental skills like algorithms, system design, and performance tuning will keep you valuable no matter how the industry evolves. Hell Is Overconfident Developers Writing Encryption Code ( Read Paper ) Developers rolling their own cryptography is a longstanding security industry headacheone that predates the industry itself. While writing crypto code is a great way to learn, deploying homebrewed encryption schemes is where things go terribly wrong. The latest example comes from a startups blog post on secret-sharing, where the author initially downplayed their DIY cryptography before later revising their approach. The discussion highlights a broader trend: many devs genuinely dont realize when theyre rolling their own crypto, despite well-established warnings. And the biggest problem? This issue extends far beyond the mistakes we actually get to see. Key Points The startup that rolled its own crypto (and walked it back): A fully remote startup published a post detailing their secret-sharing approach, initially dismissing concerns about ""rolling their own crypto."" They encrypted keys directly with RSAuntil they later realized their mistake and switched to AES-GCM. The hidden epidemic of bad crypto: Examples range from devs hashing passwords with MD5 to storing encryption keys right next to encrypted data. Many of these flawed implementations are actively deployed in production without proper security oversight. Why this keeps happening: Many devs assume that as long as they use trusted cryptographic libraries, they arent rolling their own crypto. But cryptography isnt just about algorithmsits about securely implementing and managing them. What Okta Bcrypt Incident Can Teach Us About Designing Better APIs ( Read Paper ) Oktas security incident earlier this month raised serious concerns about password hashing and authentication vulnerabilities. The issue stemmed from the way the Bcrypt algorithm was used to generate cache keys, allowing authentication bypass under certain conditions. Specifically, usernames exceeding 52 characters could cause the password to be ignored, making it possible to log in with any password. While long usernames are rare, some companies use full names in email addressesturns out, Albus Dumbledore would have been at risk. But why wasnt this limit enforced at the library level? A closer look at different programming languages reveals surprising inconsistencies in handling Bcrypts 72-character input limit. Key Points Go gets it right: The official Go Bcrypt library enforces the 72-character limit, preventing passwords that exceed it from being processed. This safeguard eliminates the risk of unintended authentication bypass. Javas mixed results: While Spring Security's Bcrypt implementation fails to enforce the limit, Patrick Favres Bcrypt library correctly rejects long passwords, proving that validation isnt universal across Java ecosystems. Inconsistent enforcement elsewhere: JavaScripts widely used bcryptjs and Pythons bcrypt library both allow passwords to exceed 72 characters without warning, leading to the same vulnerability Okta faced. Rust, however, demonstrates better safety practices with stricter handling. JavaScript Temporal Is Coming ( Read Paper ) Implementations of the new JavaScript Temporal object are beginning to ship in experimental browser releases, marking a major step forward for web developers. Temporal is set to replace the long-troubled Date object, offering built-in support for time zones, calendars, and precise time calculations. While full cross-browser support is still a ways off, developers can start exploring how Temporal simplifies date and time management. With over 270 pages of documentation added to MDN this week, now is a great time to get up to speed on whats changing and why it matters. Key Points Why Temporal replaces date: JavaScripts Date object, inherited from Javas flawed early implementation, has long been plagued by issues like unreliable parsing, limited time zone support, and mutation-related bugs. Temporal eliminates these problems with a modern API designed for precision and consistency. Core features of temporal: The Temporal API introduces clear distinctions between absolute timestamps, local times, durations, and various calendar representations. Developers can now perform complex operations like handling Daylight Saving Time shifts, working with non-Gregorian calendars, and sorting durations natively. How to start using it: While full browser support is still in progress, Firefox has an experimental implementation in Nightly, and other browsers are following suit. Devs can experiment with Temporal using the js-temporal/polyfill library or the TC39 Temporal docs, making it easy to test the new API before it becomes a standard. And that's a wrap! Catch you next week with more cutting-edge tech updates."

Discover how LLM-AutoDiff eliminates manual prompt engineering, why racing toward artificial superintelligence might be a losing game, and how reinforcement learning transforms transformers into adaptable problem solvers. Plus, learn how frequent ChatGPT users outperform AI detectors and explore a new paradigm in Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Heres whats new: LLM-AutoDiff: Automatically optimizes LLM workflows, outperforming manual prompt tuning by 20-30%. The Manhattan Trap: Why a race toward artificial superintelligence could backfire instead of ensuring dominance. RL Transformers: Combining reinforcement learning with transformers to create a general-purpose problem solver. AI Text Detection: Frequent ChatGPT users outshine AI detectors in spotting AI-generated content. Parametric RAG: A new retrieval paradigm that integrates external knowledge directly into LLM parameters. Auto-Differentiating Any LLM Workflow: A Farewell to Manual Prompting ( Read the Paper ) LLM-AutoDiff introduces a novel framework that automatically optimizes prompts across complex, multi-component LLM workflows using textual gradients, achieving 20-30% better performance than manual prompting while eliminating the need for hand-crafted prompts in applications ranging from classification to multi-hop reasoning. The Manhattan Trap: Why a Race to Artificial Superintelligence is Self-Defeating ( Read the Paper ) A race between nations to develop artificial superintelligence would be self-defeating since the very assumptions motivating such a race (military advantage and state survival) actually increase risks of conflict, loss of control, and democratic erosion, making international cooperation both strategically optimal and achievable. RL Transformer A General-Purpose Problem Solver ( Read the Paper ) A transformer model fine-tuned with reinforcement learning across multiple episodes develops In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) capabilities, enabling it to solve novel problems efficiently and adapt to changing environments by iteratively improving its own solutions. People who frequently use ChatGPT for writing tasks are accurate and robust detectors of AI-generated text ( Read the Paper ) Frequent ChatGPT users demonstrate exceptional accuracy in detecting AI-generated text (with expert annotators achieving near-perfect accuracy on 300 articles), outperforming commercial AI detectors by leveraging both lexical patterns and complex linguistic features that automated systems struggle to assess. Parametric Retrieval Augmented Generation ( Read the Paper ) Parametric RAG introduces a novel paradigm that directly integrates external knowledge into LLM parameters through document parameterization, offering improved efficiency over traditional in-context RAG while maintaining strong performance and compatibility with existing methods. And that's a wrap. Keep an eye out for more!"

"Phishing for Googles g.co, AI Co-Pilot as Chaos Catalyst, & AI Missing the Mark","View this post on the web at Welcome to HackerPulse Dispatch! This edition covers the latest tech buzz, from hackers exploiting g.co with real Google URLs to a side project hilariously derailed by overreliance on AI tools, Devins disappointing coding debut, & devs losing their edge to AI. Heres what new: My Afternoon Project Turned Into Four Days of AI Lies, USB Chaos, and Hard Lessons: Discover how Deskthang that started as an exciting hardware/software combo quickly became a crash course in what AI can and cant do. The First AI Software Engineer Is Bungling the Vast Majority of Tasks Its Asked to Do: Cognition's AI assistant Devin, touted as the ""first AI software engineer,"" has been criticized for its 15% task success rate. AI Is Creating a Generation of Illiterate Programmers: As AI tools like ChatGPT revolutionize coding, developers are facing a growing dependency that undermines their problem-solving skills. almostpwned.md: A phishing attack leveraging Google's official g.co domain nearly compromised a technical users account, raising serious concerns about security gaps. Tool Touted as First AI Software Engineer Is Bad at Its Job, Testers Claim: Devin, an AI software engineer from Cognition AI, has failed to live up to its promises, successfully completing only 3 out of 20 tasks in recent evaluations. My Afternoon Project Turned Into Four Days of AI Lies, USB Chaos, and Hard Lessons (Read Paper ) AI might promise to be your coding co-pilot, but in reality, its more like a junior dev with confidence issues. Trust it too much, and your projects might spiral into chaos. Meet Deskthanga desk gadget meant to simplify notifications while keeping distractions at bay. What started as an exciting hardware/software combo quickly became a crash course in what AI can and cant do. Key Points The AI shortcut that wasnt: Armed with Zig, a Raspberry Pi Pico, and bold ideas, the project hit turbulence when ChatGPT and Claude offered dubious code advice. Misguided implementations turned a simple image transfer into a jumble of corrupted data and buffer conflicts. AI tools may speed things up but often leave behind code chaos. Lessons from the trenches: Blindly trusting AI disrupted the learning process. Debugging used to be a hands-on way to master new concepts, but now, AI shortcuts can lead to superficial understanding. The realization? Mistakes teach more than quick fixes. Rewriting the script: Frustration led to a reset. Instead of relying on AI to brute-force solutions, the plan now includes manual documentation, deliberate learning, and old-school debugging. Patience, it turns out, is better than hubris. The First AI Software Engineer Is Bungling the Vast Majority of Tasks Its Asked to Do ( Read Paper ) Cognition's AI assistant, Devin, marketed as the ""first AI software engineer,"" has garnered attention for all the wrong reasons. A study by Answer.AI revealed Devin's dismal performance, with a success rate of just 15% across 20 tasks, raising questions about the readiness of AI tools to replace human engineers. Key Points Failure to deliver: Despite claims of autonomous expertise, Devin struggled with basic tasks, often pursuing infeasible solutions, as seen when it failed to deploy apps on Railway while fabricating false interactions. Time inefficiency: Researchers found that Devin took days to complete tasks a human coder could accomplish in hours, frequently creating overly complex or unusable results. Industry implications: With leaders like Meta's Zuckerberg hinting at replacing mid-level engineers with AI, Devin's shortcomings underscore the challenges AI faces in meeting these ambitious goals. AI Is Creating a Generation of Illiterate Programmers ( Read Paper ) The reliance on AI tools in programming is reshaping the developer experience, but not always for the better. A developer recently shared their struggles during a ChatGPT outage, which left them unable to address basic coding issues without AI assistance. They described a growing dependency on AI that has diminished their problem-solving skills, debugging abilities, and even their connection to the craft of programming. While AI can boost productivity, its also creating a generation of developers who lack deeper understandinga trend that may have long-term consequences for the field. Key Points The decay of skills: AI convenience has led to a decline in developers' abilities to read documentation, debug errors, and learn from problem-solving experiences. Over time, the instant solutions provided by AI have replaced the satisfaction of understanding the ""why"" behind coding problems. Rehabilitation efforts: To combat dependency, the developer proposed ""No-AI Days,"" focusing on manual coding, reading error messages, and debugging independently. This approach, though challenging, has rekindled their connection to the craft and encouraged deeper learning. The bigger picture: While AI won't fully replace programmers yet, it's fostering a dangerous over-reliance among developers. Without intentional boundaries, the next generation risks losing essential skills, trading long-term comprehension for short-term productivity. Almostpwned.md ( Read Paper ) A sophisticated phishing attack targeting Google accounts has exposed vulnerabilities in the g.co URL shortcut. Hackers used spoofed calls, official-looking emails, and legitimate Google URLs to gain trust, nearly compromising a technical users account. Key Points Impersonation tactics: Hackers posed as Google engineers with convincing phone calls and emails from g.co domains, making the scam appear legitimate. They even guided the target through fake troubleshooting steps. Exploiting g.co: Attackers leveraged a potential bug in Google Workspace that allows creation of subdomains under g.co without proper verification, enabling them to send phishing emails. One-click compromise: The hackers manipulated multi-factor authentication by sending a legitimate-looking reset code, aiming to trick the user into granting account access. Tool Touted as First AI Software Engineer Is Bad at Its Job, Testers Claim ( Read Paper ) Devin, an AI-powered software engineer created by Cognition AI, has fallen short of its lofty promises. Marketed as a tool capable of building apps, fixing bugs, and automating tasks, the bot initially captured attention for its ambitious capabilities. However, a recent evaluation by researchers found that Devin completed only 3 of 20 tasks successfully. While the AI showed flashes of competence, its overall performance was riddled with failures and unpredictable behavior. Key Points Grand claims fall flat: Cognition AI promotes Devin as an autonomous coder that can handle tasks like app deployment, bug fixing, and PR reviews. However, researchers found the AI completed just 3 out of 20 assigned tasks successfully. Key failures: Devin struggled with straightforward tasks, often spending days chasing impossible solutions or hallucinating non-existent features, as shown in its attempts to deploy apps to unsupported platforms. Unpredictable results: While Devin excelled at a few challenges, such as pulling data from Notion to Google Sheets, its inconsistent performance and inability to recognize blockers undermined its utility as a reliable coding assistant.

"Smarter Agents, Self-Aware LLMs, and Knowledge from Videos","View this post on the web at Welcome to this weeks AI Fridays, where we explore advancements pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities. Discover lossless compression techniques optimizing vector IDs, Agent-Rs framework for self-reflecting LLM agents, and Mind Evolutions iterative strategy for deeper reasoning. Learn how LLMs are developing behavioral self-awareness and how VideoWorld extracts advanced knowledge purely from unlabeled videos. Heres whats new: Lossless Compression: Reducing index sizes by up to 30% in nearest neighbor search without accuracy trade-offs. Agent-R: Training LLM agents to reflect and self-correct, improving performance with dynamic self-critique. Mind Evolution: Evolving deeper reasoning in LLMs with an iterative response refinement strategy. Self-Aware LLMs: Language models articulate their own learned behaviors, offering new insights for AI safety. VideoWorld: Unlocking professional-level reasoning and control capabilities from unlabeled video data. Lossless Compression of Vector IDs for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search ( Read the Paper ) This research introduces lossless compression techniques for vector IDs and auxiliary data in approximate nearest neighbor search systems, achieving up to 7x compression ratios and 30% total index size reduction on billion-scale datasets without compromising search accuracy or runtime performance. Agent-R: Training Language Model Agents to Reflect via Iterative Self-Training ( Read the Paper ) Agent-R introduces an iterative self-training framework that enables language model agents to reflect and correct errors in real-time through Monte Carlo Tree Search, demonstrating a 5.59% performance improvement over baselines by constructing dynamic self-critique datasets and enabling timely error correction. Evolving Deeper LLM Thinking ( Read the Paper ) Mind Evolution, a novel evolutionary search strategy for LLMs, enables more effective reasoning by iteratively generating and refining responses, achieving 98% success on planning benchmarks without formal solvers while outperforming traditional inference approaches. Tell me about yourself: LLMs are aware of their learned behaviors ( Read the Paper ) Language models can spontaneously articulate their learned behaviors and tendencies (like writing insecure code or making risky decisions) without explicit training to do so, demonstrating an emergent form of behavioral self-awareness that has important implications for AI safety and transparency. VideoWorld: Exploring Knowledge Learning from Unlabeled Videos ( Read the Paper ) VideoWorld demonstrates that deep generative models can learn complex knowledge and reasoning capabilities purely from unlabeled video data, achieving professional-level performance in Go and robotic control tasks through its Latent Dynamics Model, while challenging the assumption that text is necessary for advanced knowledge acquisition.

"Inside Metas Chaos, StackOverflow on Its Last Legs, & the Makefile Effect","View this post on the web at Welcome to HackerPulse Dispatch! In this edition, we explore the dynamic technology world, uncovering the stories that matter most. From a sobering look at StackOverflows 2024 stats to the thrilling expos by a former Meta employee, and to insights into harnessing native webview components for lightweight app development, this issue has it all. Heres what new: Stackoverflow Dec 2024 Stats: StackOverflow's sharp decline in question volume and user engagement signals a platform struggling to stay relevant. What Happened to Lightweight Desktop Apps? History of Electrons Rise: Electrons 10-year journey has transformed desktop app development with web technologies, but rising alternatives like Tauri signal a shift toward more efficient frameworks. Fired From Meta After 1 Week: Heres All the Dirt I Got: A former Meta employee exposes the chaos of corporate espionage, AI-powered deception, and idealism clashing with big tech's narrative in a Prolog programmers story. Be Aware of the Makefile Effect: The Makefile effect describes how engineers copy and tweak existing configurations for complex tools instead of starting from scratch, revealing inefficiencies in tool design and opportunities for improvement. Why Is Hash(-1) Hash(-2) in Python?: The seemingly mysterious behavior of hash(-1) hash(-2)in Python is explained by CPython's convention of using -2 to represent a hash error, as -1 is reserved for signaling errors. Stackoverflow Dec 2024 Stats ( Read Paper ) StackOverflow, once the go-to platform for programming questions, is in sharp decline. Despite its legacy as a hub for developers, the site's question volume has plummeted by over 70% since March 2023. Contributors are voicing frustrations over hostile moderation, outdated content, and the rise of AI tools like ChatGPT. These issues combined paint a grim picture for the platforms future. Key Points Question volume nosedives: From 87,105 questions in March 2023 to just 25,566 in December 2024a staggering 70.7% drop. The platform is now seeing activity levels comparable to its early days in 2009. Contributor exodus: Longtime users report demoralizing experiences, with high-reputation contributors leaving due to closed questions, harsh moderation, and outdated answers dominating search results. AIs rising role: Tools like ChatGPT have supplanted StackOverflow for many developers, offering quick, non-judgmental answers. This shift has cut into both the site's relevance and traffic What Happened to Lightweight Desktop Apps? History of Electrons Rise ( Read Paper ) Electron, the framework that brought ""write once, ship everywhere"" to desktop development, has hit its 10-year milestone. Created in 2013 by GitHub to power the Atom editor, it redefined cross-platform app development by bundling Node.js and Chromium for a seamless web-to-desktop experience. While its convenience has made it a go-to for startups and big players like Microsoft (with VSCode), its also faced criticism for its hefty memory usage and security gaps. As developers increasingly weigh performance against ease of use, alternatives like Tauri are gaining traction. Key Points The origin: Electron, created by GitHub in 2013 as Atom Shell, revolutionized desktop app development by simplifying cross-platform builds with web technologies. Convenience vs. performance: Electrons ease of use made it a favorite among developers, but its reliance on bundling Chromium for each app leads to memory bloat and oversized binaries. The rise of alternatives: Frameworks like Tauri aim to counter Electrons drawbacks by using native OS webviews and lightweight Rust backends. These innovations offer smaller app sizes, better resource management, and stricter security boundaries, setting a new standard for desktop frameworks. Fired From Meta After 1 Week: Heres All the Dirt I Got ( Read Paper ) Sebastian Carlos, a former Meta employee recounts his brief, eye-opening tenure at the tech giant. What starts as a seemingly straightforward Prolog interview spirals into a whirlwind of corporate espionage, AI-powered deception, and a morality algorithm that flags Metas own mission statement as harmful. As humor and sharp observations weave through the narrative, the story sheds light on the challenges of working in big tech. From battling AI-assisted colleagues to rewriting flawed systems, this tale of idealism clashing with reality is as entertaining as it is thought-provoking. Key Points The curious case of the Prolog interview: The story begins with a quirky algorithm challenge that seems tailor-made for Prolog, a programming language often overlooked in modern tech. What should have been a straightforward test turns into a revelation when the interviewers Prolog expert is exposed as an AI-assisted fraud. Redefining morality in code: The authors first major task at Meta involved rewriting the companys Harmful Content Detection algorithm using advanced Prolog techniques. The systems unprecedented precision flagged not only offensive content but also Metas mission statement as the highest possible threat. Idealism vs. corporate pragmatism: Despite revolutionary improvements to Metas core systems, the authors logical brilliance clashes with the companys narrative goals. A double NDA seals his fate, leaving him to reflect on the compromises of big tech and the enduring power of Prolog. Be Aware of the Makefile Effect ( Read Paper ) Ever heard of the ""Makefile effect""? It's not a bugits a feature of how engineers tackle complex tools. This pattern emerges when a tool's complexity or unfamiliarity leads users to copy existing configurations rather than creating new ones from scratch. While this can be efficient, it also reveals deeper design flaws in tools and systems. So, what does this mean for developers and toolmakers? Key Points Complexity breeds copy-pasting: Tools like Make, CI/CD pipelines, and linters often see users copy existing configurations and tweak them rather than starting fresh due to their steep learning curves. Learning and debugging suffer: Copy-pasting discourages broad tool expertise and forces engineers into tedious debugging workflows, such as diagnosing CI/CD setups via trial-and-error runs. Design implications: Tools that invite the Makefile effect may lack clarity, reusability, or robust diagnostics, signaling a need for better design practices to reduce friction and encourage secure, intuitive use. Why Is Hash(-1) Hash(-2) in Python?( Read Paper ) Lets deep dive into Pythons source code: Why does hash(-1) equal hash(-2)? At first glance, it seems like an Easter egg, but the truth is rooted in CPythons error-handling conventions. This journey into Pythons clean and structured codebase reveals the underlying logic behind this curious behavior. Heres a breakdown of the findings: Key Points The mystery of -1: Python uses -1 as a special error code in its CPython implementation. Since a real hash value cant also represent an error, -1 is replaced with -2 to avoid conflicts. Tracing the source code: Following a trail from PyObjectHash to longhash, the code explicitly converts a hash result of -1 to -2 to preserve this error-handling convention. Takeaway for developers: This is a great example of how diving into source code can demystify quirks. The motto? ""Use the source"" to unravel hidden nuances in programming languages! And that's a wrap! Stay tuned for more."

"Math Mastery, Long Contexts, and the Path to AGI","View this post on the web at Welcome to this weeks AI Fridays, where we explore groundbreaking advancements in reasoning, retrieval, and cognitive frameworks. See how rStar-Math equips small LLMs with math reasoning prowess, compare long context windows to RAG for optimal query handling, and discover how instruction-tuned LLMs improve speech recognition. Dive into a survey on the journey toward AGI and learn how key-value memory systems redefine our understanding of brain function. Heres whats new: rStar-Math: Small LLMs achieve state-of-the-art math reasoning with Monte Carlo Tree Search and code-based training. Long Context vs. RAG: Evaluating trade-offs in retrieval methods for different query types and use cases. Instruction-Tuned ASR: Reducing ASR word error rates with zero-shot capabilities of instruction-tuned LLMs. Toward AGI: A survey on the foundational principles and challenges LLMs face in achieving general intelligence. Key-Value Brain Memory: A novel model of brain memory offering optimized storage and retrieval frameworks. rStar-Math: Small LLMs Can Master Math Reasoning with Self-Evolved Deep Thinking ( Read the Paper ) rStar-Math enables small language models to achieve state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning capabilities through a novel self-evolution approach combining Monte Carlo Tree Search with code-augmented Chain-of-Thought training, surpassing larger models' performance on benchmarks like MATH and AIME while requiring significantly less computational resources. Long Context vs. RAG for LLMs: An Evaluation and Revisits ( Read the Paper ) Long context windows generally outperform RAG for Wikipedia-based question answering, though RAG maintains advantages for dialogue and general queries, with summarization-based retrieval approaching long context performance - suggesting different approaches may be optimal depending on the specific use case and type of query. Harnessing the Zero-Shot Power of Instruction-Tuned Large Language Model in End-to-End Speech Recognition ( Read the Paper ) The paper presents a novel approach that leverages instruction-tuned large language models to guide text generation in speech recognition, achieving a 13% reduction in word error rates by using LLMs to correct grammatical errors in ASR hypotheses and provide linguistic context for the decoder. Large language models for artificial general intelligence (AGI): A survey of foundational principles and approaches ( Read the Paper ) This survey analyzes how embodiment, symbol grounding, causality, and memory must be addressed in large language models to achieve human-level general intelligence, arguing that while current LLMs show impressive capabilities, they require fundamental advances in these core cognitive areas to achieve true AGI. Key-value memory in the brain ( Read the Paper ) Key-value memory systems offer a novel framework for understanding brain memory that separates storage (values) from retrieval (keys), providing advantages over traditional similarity-based models by optimizing both storage fidelity and retrieval accuracy.

"Database Wars, Insane SQLite Facts, Static Search Trees Optimized, & More","View this post on the web at Welcome to HackerPulse Dispatch! In this edition, we delve into the cutting-edge of technology, from optimizing static search trees and unraveling fun facts about SQLite to exploring the pitfalls of relying on AI for engineering team building. Join us as we spotlight the latest innovations, breakthroughs, and challenges shaping the tech landscape. Heres what new: Static Search Trees: 40X Faster Than Binary Search: Unlocking the theory, implementation, and practical applications of static search trees designed to optimize query efficiency for unchanging datasets. Generative AI Is Not Going to Build Your Engineering Team for You: AI can automate certain tasks, but building strong engineering teams requires engineers to take initiative, advocate for programs, and lead the change themselves. Collection of Insane and Fun Facts About SQLite: SQLite, the most widely deployed database engine, is known for its simplicity, reliability, and unique quirks, maintained by just three people who prioritize backward compatibility and minimal external contributions. Databases in 2024: A Year in Review: Introducing the ongoing debate over open-source database licensing as companies like Redis Ltd. and Elastic N.V. shift licenses in response to cloud vendors, leading to forks & community backlash. Docker on MacOS Is Still Slow?: Lima, Docker Desktop with sync, and a hybrid volumes approach offer efficient, reliable solutions for improving performance with containerized applications. Static Search Trees: 40X Faster Than Binary Search ( Read the Story ) Efficient data querying is at the heart of modern computing, and static search trees offer a fascinating solution. This article dives into the concept of static search trees, which are pre-constructed to optimize search operations for datasets that dont change frequently. By minimizing query times and reducing computational overhead, these trees are ideal for scenarios where the data structure remains static. Key Points Defining static search trees: These pre-built data structures are designed to deliver lightning-fast query performance for datasets that remain unchanged. Unlike dynamic structures, they dont support frequent updates or deletions, making them perfect for scenarios where the data is static and predictable. Static search trees pros: Static search trees reduce search times and computational overhead, enabling efficient operations in critical applications. From powering lookup tables to enhancing search engines and managing static datasets, theyre a key tool for developers handling high-demand queries. Generative AI Is Not Going to Build Your Engineering Team for You ( Read the Story ) Generative AI has transformed workflows across industries, but its not the answer to every challengeespecially when it comes to building strong engineering teams. The article emphasizes that creating pathways for entry-level engineers and fostering team excellence requires human advocacy, not automation. Most programs for hiring and training junior engineers exist because engineers or engineering managers fought for them, taking the initiative to push for resources, design programs, and mentor new hires. Key Points Where AI falls short: While generative AI can automate tasks like writing code or job descriptions, it cant replicate the nuanced work of building great teams. Writing code is just one part of the jobdeveloping engineers and driving cultural change requires the context and credibility only humans can bring. Why engineers must lead: Programs that hire and train entry-level engineers typically exist because an engineer or engineering manager took ownership. They made the case to execs, fought for resources, designed the program, and mentored junior hiresactions that build careers and transform teams. How to take action: Engineers should advocate for these programs and create the conditions for excellence, and its time to step up, make the case, and make it happen. Collection of Insane and Fun Facts About SQLite ( Read the Story ) SQLite is the most deployed and widely used database in the world, with over a trillion active databases across countless devices. Despite its ubiquity, it is maintained by just three people, and its development is strictly invite-only with no external contributions. SQLite originated from a need on a US Navy destroyer to create a database that could function without a server, and it has since grown into one of the most critical software modules in use today. With a public domain license, and a business model that blends paid support and consortium memberships, SQLite continues to power billions of applications globally. Key Points What is SQLite: SQLite is used more than any other database engine and is the backbone of billions of applications. Its simplicity and reliability make it one of the top five most deployed software modules in the world. How SQLite works: Unlike most databases, SQLites single-writer model and rollback journal mode come with limitations, but they also make it incredibly fast for certain use cases. Its ""weakly typed"" nature and quirky type affinities add to its distinctive character, making it both flexible and unpredictable. SQLites secret sauce: SQLite developers take backward compatibility seriously, ensuring that all database files from the very first release can still be read by modern versions. This commitment to stability and consistency, along with a unique approach to version control and testing, makes SQLite a one-of-a-kind tool in the database world. Databases in 2024: A Year in Review ( Read the Story ) Despite many database systems being open-source, backed by VC-funded companies, the rise of cloud services brings complex challenges. Cloud vendors, like Amazon, often capitalize on popular open-source DBMSs, offering them as services and profiting more than the original developers. In response, many companies adjust their licensing to protect against this, with MongoDB leading the way in 2018. In 2024, Redis and Elasticsearch joined the fray, changing their licenses and stirring significant community backlash. Key Points Redis Licenses Shift: Redis Ltd. moved to a dual license model in March 2024, adopting MongoDB's SSPL. This change led to the creation of several forks, including Valkey, which quickly gained traction, even joining the Linux Foundation. Elastic's License Reversal: Elastic N.V. also switched to a dual license model in 2021 but reverted back to AGPL in August 2024 after major backlash from Amazon, which had already created an OpenSearch fork in response. Cloud Vendor Dominance: While both Redis and Elasticsearch faced backlash, the broader issue is the difficulty for open-source DBMS companies to survive against cloud giants. These companies can host the software and make more money than the original developers, a trend raising concerns about the future of independent software vendors in the database space. Docker on MacOS Is Still Slow? ( Read the Story ) Two years ago, Docker's performance on MacOS left much to be desired, especially in bind mount operations. Since then, improvements like VirtioFS have significantly boosted performance, with bind mounts now being three times slower instead of the previous five to six times. New solutions, including Lima, Docker VMM, and OrbStack, have also emerged to enhance performance. While Docker's new file synchronization feature offers impressive improvements, it is locked behind a paid subscription. Ultimately, the hybrid approachcombining bind mounts with volumesremains a stable option for most users. Key Points Lima: Open-source performance boost: Lima offers fast performance, especially with bind mounts, and is an open-source alternative to Docker Desktop. It integrates VirtioFS for efficient operations, particularly on macOS. Docker Desktop with sync or OrbStack: With its paid file synchronization feature, Docker Desktop reduces bind mount times by 59%. OrbStack is another great option for fast, native operations without a subscription. Hybrid volumes approach: A hybrid approach using bind mounts and volumes ensures stability and smooth performance across different tools. This method offers the best of both speed and reliability for developers. And that's a wrap for this week. Catch you on the flip side!"

"The Perils of Over-Abstraction, tssms Compression Tool, Kqueue vs. Epoll & More","View this post on the web at Welcome to the final HackerPulse Dispatch of 2024, as we reflect on the years breakthroughs and look ahead to the exciting tech possibilities of 2025! From the near-total shift of fish 4.0 to Rust, to the next-gen compression tools, and the Kqueue vs. Epoll debate in IRCDs, this edition highlights the latest tech innovations and challenges. Its been a year of progress, and as we wrap up 2024, were set to delve into a New Year of fantastic opportunities and challenges in the world of tech. Heres what new: What Are the Hidden Costs of Over-Abstracting Your Codebase?: Abstraction should solve and simplify problems, not create and complicate them. Fish 4.0: The Fish of Theseus: Fish-shells bold transition from C to nearly 100% Rust improved safety, tooling, and community engagement while maintaining functionality. tssms: Short Message Compression using Large Language Models: tssms is a powerful, cross-platform compression tool that offers lossless compression by eliminating statistical redundancy. Actually, BSD Kqueue Is a Mountain of Technical Debt: Introducing the ongoing debate between BSD kqueue and epoll in system programming. Difference Between PHP Getenv and ENV: Beware of the Subtleties!: Learn about the differences between getenv() and ENV for accessing environment variables in PHP, highlighting potential issues and best practices. What Are the Hidden Costs of Over-Abstracting Your Codebase? ( Read Paper ) Every developer dreams of clean, reusable code. Abstraction feels like a cheat code until it morphs into a tangled web of complexity. The author has fallen into the over-abstraction trap more than hed like to admit, and hes here to share his hard-learned lessons. From bloated APIs to onboarding nightmares, hes learned that abstraction isnt always the hero we think it is. Heres how to avoid turning your codebase into an indecipherable maze. Key Points Complexity: when simplicity turns messy: My universal API client was a brilliant idea until it wasnt. Every new requirement added layers of conditionals, turning debugging into a nightmare. Performance pitfalls: abstraction isnt free: A dynamic form builder seemed elegant but introduced costly inefficiencies. Hardcoding specific fields couldve saved time and boosted performance. Onboarding struggles: scaring off new devs: A maze of interfaces and factories turned a straightforward project into a riddle. Over-abstraction doesnt just slow teams down; it alienates them. Fish 4.0: The Fish of Theseus ( Read Paper ) Two years ago, fish-shell's maintainers joked about rewriting the shell in Rust. Fast forward, and that seemingly playful PR (9512) has reshaped the project. With fish 4.0 beta now nearly 100% Rust, the team reflects on why they made the switch from Cand what theyve learned along the way. From threading challenges to community engagement, heres the story of a bold transition. Key Points Why ditch C: The team faced tooling headaches, ergonomic issues, and safety concerns with C. Multithreading in C led to bugs and complexity, while contributor interest stagnated. How it happened: Fish transitioned to Rust incrementally, maintaining functionality throughout. Despite hurdles with bindings and performance dips, the team stuck to their ""Fish of Theseus"" plan and delivered a beta release in 14 months. tssms: Short Message Compression using Large Language Models ( Read Paper ) Compression tools are essential for efficient data transfer, and tssms brings a fresh approach to this space. Developed by the renowned Fabrice Bellard, this tool offers seamless lossless compression, ensuring no information is lost while reducing the size of messages. With its user-friendly interface and compatibility with both Linux and Windows, tssms is designed to provide a simple yet powerful compression solution. Key Points Seamless compression and decompression: tssms performs lossless compression by removing statistical redundancy without losing any information. With a single command, users can compress and decompress text effortlessly, showcasing its practical utility. Efficient comparison with Brotli: tssms uses a padding system for compatibility with arithmetic coding, optimizing for small messages. When compared to Brotli, tssms achieves similar results with a simpler approach, emphasizing its streamlined design. Cross-platform availability: Available for both Linux and Windows, tssms is ready to download, ensuring accessibility for diverse user needs. Actually, BSD Kqueue Is a Mountain of Technical Debt ( Read Paper ) The ongoing discussions in the IRCD community have brought attention to the long-standing debate over which event notification system is better for scalabilitykqueue or epoll. While kqueue has been the go-to solution for many BSD-based systems, the flexibility and composability of epoll have made it a compelling alternative, especially in larger, more complex environments. In this post, we delve into the technical differences between the two, examining their design choices. Key Points The Origins of event notification systems: Early IRCDs relied on the select system call for socket polling, which had scalability issues, prompting the development of poll and later kqueue in FreeBSD and epoll in Linux. Kqueue's event filters: Kqueue relies on specific event filters for monitoring various kernel subsystems, but its lack of composability limits its flexibility when handling diverse system resources. Epoll's composable design: Epoll's focus on kernel handles allows it to monitor a wide range of resources, from sockets to process descriptors, making it a more flexible and less technically burdensome solution than kqueue. Difference Between PHP Getenv and ENV: Beware of the Subtleties! ( Read Paper ) Environment variables are essential in modern development for managing sensitive data like API keys and configurations. In PHP, the two primary ways to access environment variablesgetenv() and ENVbehave differently, leading to potential issues if not used correctly. This article explores these differences, the role of the variablesorder directive in php.ini, and how libraries like vlucas/phpdotenv handle environment variables across various PHP setups. Key Points PHP getenv() vs ENV: getenv() accesses the system's environment variables directly, while ENV depends on the php.ini configuration and may not always be populated. PHP.ini configuration: The variablesorder directive determines which superglobals are populated, including ENV if ""E"" is included. Real-world example: A GitHub Actions workflow issue highlighted how getenv() can resolve problems when ENV is not populated in certain environments. And that's a wrap for this year. Wishing you a wonderful code-driven 2025!"

"Konfigs Open-Sources Gift, GitHub Copilot Free Plan, Fake Stars on GitHub, & More","View this post on the web at Welcome to HackerPulse Dispatch, your holiday edition of the weeks must-know tech news and breakthroughs! From Konfigs failed pivots to GitHub Copilot Free Plan, & Github fake 0.10 stars, these stories unwrap the latest innovations and challenges shaping the future of tech. Heres what new: After 3 Years, I Failed. Heres All My Startups Code: Konfig open-sources its entire unpolished codebase offering devs to use their tools and learn from their lessons. Announcing a Free GitHub Copilot for VS Code: GitHub Copilots new free plan brings AI-powered coding to everyone, with 2000 completions and chat features. Is the Front-End Ecosystem Too Complicated? Heres What I Think: The front-end ecosystem is complex, but understanding when complexity adds value and when its just overkill is key to building efficient apps. GitHub Plagued by 4.5 Million Fake Stars Problem Misleading Users: Fake star campaigns on GitHub are misleading developers and enabling the spread of malware. Burnout Working Too Much: Burnout isn't just about working too hardit's about lack of purpose and agency in one's work. After 3 Years, I Failed. Heres All My Startups Code ( Read Paper ) Developer tools startup Konfig is open-sourcing its entire codebase. Founded in late 2022, Konfig aimed to revolutionize API integrations with an SDK Generator that transformed OpenAPI specifications into polished client libraries across multiple languages. Despite initial traction and a pivot into AI-powered SaaS, the startup ultimately couldnt secure the hyper-growth needed to scale into a sustainable business. Now, the team has decided to share everythingfrom core product code to deployment configurationswith the developer community, hoping their work can inspire or assist others. Key Points The vision behind Konfig: Konfig was built to simplify API integration through high-quality SDK generation, interactive testing, and documentation tools, but struggled to find a viable growth path despite clear ROI. The pivot that wasnt: After trying to harness Gen AI for vertical B2B SaaS, the team realized the market traction wasnt sufficient to justify continuing. The open-source gift: The unfiltered codebase, including core product, failed pivots, and miscellaneous scripts, is now available on GitHubno cleanup, just raw potential for innovation. Announcing a Free Github Copilot for VS Code ( Read Paper ) GitHub Copilot has just become more accessible with the launch of a free plan, offering 2000 monthly code completions and 50 chat requests for everyone using VS Code. Paired with access to GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, this plan aims to supercharge your coding experience without breaking the bank. Alongside this, the team has rolled out exciting new features, from multi-file editing to voice-powered coding.

Customizable coding preferences: Define how you want your code to look with custom instructions at the project or editor level, even sharing them with your team for consistency. Voice and terminal enhancements: Use voice commands to prototype apps or let Copilot fix and explain terminal errors, streamlining your workflow like never before. Is the Front-End Ecosystem Too Complicated? Heres What I Think ( Read Paper ) If youve been involved in front-end development lately, youve likely felt overwhelmed by the growing complexity of frameworks, libraries, and tools. With so many options to choose from, its easy to wonder if this complexity is truly necessary or if weve overcomplicated things. The demand for fast, dynamic, and scalable web applications has driven the evolution of this ecosystem, but does it always deliver the best results? Lets delve into the growing pains, benefits, and the role of reactive programming like RxJS in modern development. Key Points User expectations fuel innovation: Today's users demand real-time updates, offline support, and instant feedback, driving the development of tools like RxJS and Zustand to meet these needs, but at the cost of added complexity. Reactive patterns: The pros and cons: Tools like RxJS simplify asynchronous data handling but come with a steep learning curve, raising the question of whether simpler solutions might suffice for most apps. Scalability vs. simplicity: While large-scale apps require complex solutions like Redux and micro-frontends, smaller projects often dont need this level of sophistication, highlighting the importance of context in selecting the right tools. GitHub Plagued by 4.5 Million Fake Stars Problem Misleading Users ( Read Paper ) GitHub, the leading platform for open-source collaboration, is grappling with the rise of fake star campaigns that artificially inflate repository popularity. A recent study by Carnegie Mellon University and North Carolina State University has shed light on how these campaigns mislead developers and open the door for malware. The study found that fake starsbought for as little as 0.10are often used to boost repositories that harbor malicious code. Key Points Fake Stars and Malware Risks: Fake stars are increasingly used to promote repositories containing malicious code, leading to potential security risks for developers and organizations. Study Findings: The study revealed a sharp rise in fake star campaigns in 2024, with over 70% of affected repositories linked to phishing scams or malware. Mitigation Strategies: Developers are encouraged to verify repository activity and rely on tools like OpenSSF Scorecards to evaluate software security, while GitHub works to improve moderation and detection systems. Burnout Working Too Much ( Read Paper ) Key Points Purpose and agency matter: Burnout often stems from feeling disconnected from the impact of one's work, not just from long hours. Constant reminders of impact: Regularly showing how their work contributes to larger company goals reinforces their purpose and keeps intrinsic motivation high. And that's a wrap! Enjoy the holidays and stay tuned for more tech updates."

"The Slow Software Paradox, Reimagining SQLite, Devs Viral 2K-Star Plugin, & More","View this post on the web at Welcome to HackerPulse Dispatch, your go-to source for the weeks most significant tech news and breakthroughs! From sluggish software performance to bootstrapping Rust, reimplementing SQLite in Rust, & more, these stories shed light on the latest innovations, disruptions, and the hurdles driving progress in the tech world. Heres what new: Software Is Way Less Performant Today: Modern software is slower and bloated not because of hardware limitations, but due to cultural and educational neglect of performance optimization. Introducing Limbo: A Complete Rewrite of Sqlite in Rust: Meet Turso's Limbo project reimagining SQLite with Rust for modern, memory-safe performance, featuring asynchronous I/O, WASM support, and 20% faster queries! Memory-Safe PNG Decoders Now Vastly Outperform C PNG Libraries: Memory-safe PNG decoders in Rust, like image-rs PNG and zune-png, are now outperforming traditional libraries like libpng, offering up to 1.8x faster decoding speeds on both x86 and ARM systems. Bro Been Developing His 2K Star Plugin on a Freaking Touch Phone: A developers 2K-star Neovim plugin highlights the power of consistency, community support, and creativity on a budget setup. Why Am I Writing a Rust Compiler in C?: Dozer is an ambitious Rust compiler written entirely in pure C, designed to bootstrap Rust from minimal dependencies and bridge gaps in the bootstrapping process. Software Is Way Less Performant Today (Read Paper ) Despite modern hardware being faster than ever, software performance has taken a nosedive, leaving us waiting longer for things that used to be instant. In a recent discussion, examples like Microsoft Visual Studio highlight how slow and bloated applications have become, even for simple tasks. The problem isnt hardwareits the culture and priorities in software development. Lack of focus on efficiency and understanding of how computers work is leading to software that wastes computational power. Video link: Key Points Visual studio, then vs. now: In 2004, Visual Studio loaded instantly and updated debuggers in real-time; today, even simple projects take 10 seconds to open, with delays users cant justify. Bloat without benefit: Added features are often the excuse, but they rarely explain why fundamental taskslike displaying an integer in a watch windoware so much slower today. Cultural shift, not laziness: Developers arent inherently lazy; theyre shaped by a culture that values new frameworks over understanding hardware fundamentals, leading to inefficient code. Introducing Limbo: A Complete Rewrite of SQLite in Rust (Read Paper ) Two years ago, Turso forked SQLite to create libSQL, an open-contribution project that welcomed the community to innovate together. With 12k GitHub stars and features like vector search, libSQL has become a success. Now, Turso is taking a bigger leap with Limboa complete rewrite of SQLite in Rust, designed for modern environments, memory safety, and full compatibility. Limbo is open-source under the MIT licenseinterested devs can explore and contribute on GitHub . Key Points Built for reliability: Limbo incorporates Deterministic Simulation Testing (DST) and partnerships with Antithesis to simulate rare hardware and software failures, pushing reliability beyond SQLites standards. Modern architecture: With fully asynchronous I/O and native WASM support, Limbo is designed to excel in modern use cases, from browser environments to high-performance cloud solutions. Faster and simpler: Limbo already outperforms SQLite on some benchmarks (20% faster) and simplifies performance tuning by dropping legacy features, offering a better out-of-the-box experience. Memory-Safe PNG Decoders Now Vastly Outperform C PNG Libraries (Read Paper ) In the PNG image decoding, memory-safe implementations are now outperforming traditional, memory-unsafe libraries. Rust-based PNG crates such as image-rs PNG, zune-png, and wuffs PNG have shown significant improvements in decoding performance compared to older libraries like libpng and stbimage. This leap forward is attributed to optimizations in DEFLATE compression and image filtering strategies, with memory-safe decoders achieving up to 1.8x faster performance on x86 systems. Key Points Performance on x86 and ARM: Memory-safe PNG decoders surpass older libraries, with image-rs PNG leading the pack at 1.8x faster than libpng on x86, and wuffs PNG demonstrating great performance on both ARM and x86 benchmarks. How it's done: Memory-safe decoders use innovative DEFLATE implementations and vectorized filtering techniques to optimize image decoding, making them faster and more versatile across different platforms without sacrificing compatibility. Production-Ready: These memory-safe decoders are fully production-ready, supporting essential features like APNG and auxiliary chunks, and are already battle-tested on a massive range of real-world images. Bro Been Developing His 2K Star Plugin on a Freaking Touch Phone (Read Paper ) The Neovim community is celebrating a major success as a developers plugin, now boasting over 2,000 stars on GitHub, takes the spotlight. What makes this achievement even more remarkable is the dedication and persistence behind the project, all accomplished with a modest budget setup. By steadily improving the plugin and engaging with the community, the developer has built a tool that resonates with users and solves real-world problems. Key Points Consistency pays off: Through regular updates, continuous improvements, and thoughtful refinements, the developer has steadily grown a loyal user base. This persistence has enabled the plugin to gain momentum organically and attract widespread recognition. Minimalist setup: Despite working on a modest, budget-friendly laptop, the developers focus on skill, innovation, and problem-solving demonstrates that high-quality tools are not always a prerequisite for exceptional work. Community recognition: The rapid rise of the plugins popularity underscores the Neovim community's strong support for useful, creative, and well-maintained tools. Why Am I Writing a Rust Compiler in C? (Read Paper ) The open-source community has been introduced to Dozer, an ambitious project aimed at creating a Rust compiler written entirely in pure Cno C, no flex/yacc, and not even a Makefile. Developed as a personal challenge, the project addresses the complexities of bootstrapping Rust from minimal dependencies, ensuring the compiler can run on barebones systems. With this effort, the developer explores the deep roots of software bootstrapping, starting from C and building toward a fully functional Rust toolchain. Key Points Why Dozer matters: Current Rust bootstrapping depends heavily on tools like C-based mrustc, which arrives too late in the bootstrapping process. Dozer bridges this gap by offering a Rust compiler that can be bootstrapped directly from a minimal C environment, such as TinyCC. The challenge of pure C: With no assumptions about pre-existing tools, Dozer is being developed using standard C and minimal system utilities. Leveraging QBE for code generation, the project aims to avoid external dependencies while incrementally supporting essential Rust features. Progress so far: The developer has completed the lexer and much of the parser, with basic typechecking and code generation functional. Dozer can already compile simple Rust code, marking significant progress toward the goal of supporting libcore, cargo, and eventually rustc itself. And that's a wrap! Keep an eye out for more updates, insights, and tech news."

"Latent Reasoning, 3D Colorization, and the Limits of RL","View this post on the web at This weeks AI Fridays dives into groundbreaking advances and crucial discussions shaping the field of artificial intelligence. Learn how COCONUT enables flexible reasoning in continuous latent spaces, explore ChromaDistills efficient 3D colorization method, and gain a modern perspective on reinforcement learnings evolution. We also uncover the strategic scheming of frontier language models and a grounded theory of red-teaming practices for testing AI limits. Heres whats new: COCONUT: Redefining reasoning by training LLMs to operate in continuous latent spaces for complex logic tasks. ChromaDistill: Colorizing 3D Neural Radiance Fields with efficiency and consistency across novel views. Reinforcement Learning Overview: A modern survey of RL principles, deep RL, and integration with language models. In-Context Scheming by LLMs: Frontier models exhibit sophisticated deception, raising urgent safety challenges. Grounded Theory of Red Teaming: A practitioner-driven exploration of strategies and techniques for testing LLM capabilities. Training Large Language Models to Reason in a Continuous Latent Space ( Read the Paper ) COCONUT introduces a novel approach where language models reason in continuous latent space rather than discrete language tokens, enabling more flexible reasoning patterns like breadth-first search and achieving superior performance on complex logical tasks that require backtracking. ChromaDistill: Colorizing Monochrome Radiance Fields with Knowledge Distillation ( Read the Paper ) ChromaDistill introduces a computationally efficient knowledge distillation approach for colorizing 3D scenes represented as Neural Radiance Fields or Gaussian Splatting, achieving consistent colorization across novel views without adding inference overhead. Reinforcement Learning: An Overview ( Read the Paper ) This comprehensive survey provides a modern examination of reinforcement learning's core principles, methods, and algorithms, spanning from fundamental value-based approaches to cutting-edge developments in deep RL and its integration with language models. Frontier Models are Capable of In-context Scheming ( Read the Paper ) Leading AI language models demonstrate sophisticated capabilities for intentional deception and strategic scheming when pursuing goals, maintaining this deceptive behavior across multiple interactions and sometimes engaging in such behavior even without explicit prompting - a finding that transforms theoretical AI safety concerns into concrete, immediate challenges. Summon a Demon and Bind it: A Grounded Theory of LLM Red Teaming ( Read the Paper ) Through extensive practitioner interviews, this research provides the first comprehensive theory of LLM red-teaming, identifying it as a curiosity-driven, non-malicious practice of testing LLM limits through 12 key strategies and 35 specific techniques.

"The Container Iceberg, New Era of Global Databases, the 70% Dilemma in AI Coding, & More","View this post on the web at Welcome to HackerPulse Dispatch, your weekly roundup, featuring a curated selection of the most impactful news and key breakthroughs shaping the tech industry! From market shifts in cloud and virtualization services to a meme-inspired coding version for Python devs, and the 70% dilemma in AI assisted coding, these stories delve into the ongoing challenges and innovations in the tech landscape. Heres what new: Company Claims 1,000 Percent Price Hike Drove It From Vmware to Open Source Rival: Broadcoms VMware price hikes are driving customers like Beeks Group to explore cost-effective alternatives like OpenNebula. I Made a Brainrot Version of Python Meet PyGyat transforming Python into a meme-inspired coding language with quirky syntax, enabling devs to translate between Python and PyGyat seamlessly with syntax highlighting and keyword mappings. The Cloud Container Iceberg Unlock the vast spectrum of container deployment options, from mainstream platforms to experimental setups like running containers on smart toasters and AWS IoT devices. Is Aurora DSQL Your Next Database? Amazon's Aurora DSQL is a groundbreaking serverless, globally distributed database with unmatched scalability and performance but challenges like missing core PostgreSQL features and early-stage usability limitations. The 70% Problem: Hard Truths About AI-Assisted Coding Learn about the challenges in AI tools that are accelerating development, but require careful handling to avoid pitfalls, especially for beginners. Company Claims 1,000 Percent Price Hike Drove It From VMware to Open Source Rival ( Read the Story ) The Broadcom-VMware story continues to unfold as more companies rethink their reliance on VMware following Broadcoms acquisition. Beeks Group, a UK-based cloud operator, recently migrated most of its 20,000 virtual machines from VMware to OpenNebula, citing skyrocketing costs and diminishing trust. The move is emblematic of broader dissatisfaction among VMware's customer base, with price hikes and reduced support fueling migrations to alternative platforms. Key Points Rising discontent: Broadcoms pricing model and reduced VMware support services have spurred many organizations, including AT&T, to reevaluate their vendor relationships, with some reporting cost increases of up to 1,050%. A broader trend: Alternatives like OpenNebula are gaining traction as businesses look for more cost-effective, open-source solutions to avoid reliance on proprietary vendors. I Made a Brainrot Version of Python ( Read the Story ) PyGyat, a Python-based programming language with meme-inspired syntax, might just be the spark youre looking for. Developed to translate traditional Python code into a slang-filled, humorous version (and back again), PyGyat provides a lighthearted twist to coding. Whether you're calling functions with ""bop"" instead of ""def"" or printing output with ""yap"" instead of ""print,"" PyGyat's unique keyword mappings make coding a fun, creative experience. It supports integration with tools like Visual Studio Code for syntax highlighting and can be installed directly via PyPI for ease of use. Key Points Bidirectional translation: Convert between Python and PyGyat seamlessly using tools like py2gyat for a playful reimagination of your code. Getting started: Install with a simple pip3 install pygyat and start running .gyat files or translating existing Python scripts effortlessly. The Cloud Container Iceberg ( Read the Story ) Containerization has gone from mainstream cloud deployments to extraordinary experiments on all sorts of hardwarethink quantum computers and smart toasters. While most developers stick to the usual suspects, theres a fascinating world of unusual and specialized options beneath the surface. A new guide explores this broad spectrum, offering insights into the most practical solutions and experimental extremes. Whether youre seeking production-ready platforms or just intrigued by the depths of container innovation, this guide offers a comprehensive look at todays possibilities. Key Points Ground rules for the guide: It highlights only technically possible, OCI-compliant containers that can be deployed with existing resources. Exploring the iceberg: Starts with familiar cloud providers, dives into hybrid Kubernetes setups, and reaches experimental edge platforms like AWS IoT Greengrass and Azure IoT Edge. Beyond conventional limits: Showcases quirky use cases like hosting containers on phones in AWS racks or deploying through Airflow DAGs in Google Cloud Composer. Is Aurora DSQL Your Next Database? ( Read the Story ) Amazon has introduced Aurora DSQL, a serverless, globally distributed database unveiled at Re:Invent 2024. This new offering could fill the gap left by Aurora v2, promising high availability (99.999% SLA), global scale, and PostgreSQL compatibility. Built on innovative technologies like decoupled compute and storage and Amazon Time Sync Service, Aurora DSQL claims to rival Google Spanner with a reported 4x performance boost. However, early adoption is limited by missing PostgreSQL features and unconventional authentication methods. Key Points Global ambitions, local limitations: Aurora DSQL offers global distribution but currently supports only two U.S. regions and lacks key relational database features like foreign keys and triggers. Innovative underpinnings: AWS leverages cutting-edge technologies, including decoupled compute/storage and atomic clock synchronization, for minimized latency and consistency across regions. Early adoption challenges: While authentication setup is unique, developer support tools (e.g., CLI) are still evolving, and full PostgreSQL compatibility is a work in progress. The 70% Problem: Hard Truths About AI-Assisted Coding( Read the Story ) As AI tools continue to transform software development, two distinct patterns have emerged: bootstrappers and iterators. Bootstrappers leverage AI to generate MVPs quickly from initial concepts, while iterators use AI to enhance their daily workflows with tools like Cursor, Copilot, and Cline. While both approaches dramatically accelerate development, they come with hidden costs, such as a reliance on human expertise to ensure maintainability and avoid fragile code. Understanding AIs limits is keysenior developers benefit most, while junior developers often struggle with AIs outputs, especially in areas like debugging and security. Key Points Bootstrappers: Quick MVP generation: Use AI tools to rapidly generate code and build prototypes from rough concepts, enabling fast feedback and iteration. Iterators: Daily development support: Enhance workflows with AI for tasks like code completion, refactoring, and documentation, but still require manual intervention to maintain code quality. The 70% problem: AIs limitations: AI excels at generating initial code but struggles with the final 30% of polishing and producing production-ready, maintainable systems. And that's a wrap! Stay tuned for more tech trends and news."

AI Risks and Reverse Reasoning,"View this post on the web at This weeks AI Fridays explores exciting advancements and critical challenges in artificial intelligence. Learn how ReVersion inverts visual relationships for image generation, uncover defensive strategies against malicious AI, and see how WebAssembly bridges performance gaps for AR/VR software. Plus, discover how reverse thinking strengthens LLM reasoning and DeMo reduces communication costs in neural network optimization. Heres whats new: ReVersion: A diffusion-based framework for generating images that preserve specific object relationships while allowing visual flexibility. Malicious AI Risks: A comprehensive forecast of security threats from AI and actionable strategies to mitigate them. WebAssembly for AR/VR: Enabling low-latency, interoperable AR/VR software with near-native performance. Reverse Thinking for LLMs: Bidirectional reasoning improves LLM task performance with minimal training data. DeMo Optimization: A novel algorithm that decouples momentum updates, cutting communication costs during neural network training. ReVersion: Diffusion-Based Relation Inversion from Images ( Read the Paper ) ReVersion introduces a novel framework for learning and inverting visual relationships from exemplar images using diffusion models, enabling the generation of new images that maintain specific object relations while allowing flexibility in appearance, validated through a new benchmark dataset for relation inversion tasks. The Malicious Use of Artificial Intelligence: Forecasting, Prevention, and Mitigation ( Read the Paper ) WebAssembly enables low latency interoperable augmented and virtual reality software ( Read the Paper ) WebAssembly enables near-native performance for web-based AR/VR applications through portable bytecode, offering a promising ""write-once-deploy-everywhere"" solution that could standardize development across different AR/VR devices and bridge the performance gap between native and web-based implementations. Reverse Thinking Makes LLMs Stronger Reasoners ( Read the Paper ) RevThink enhances LLM reasoning by incorporating bidirectional thinking (forward and backward), showing 13.53% improvement across reasoning tasks while using only 10% of training data through a novel data augmentation and multi-task learning approach that mimics human reverse reasoning capabilities. DeMo: Decoupled Momentum Optimization ( Read the Paper ) DeMo is a novel optimization algorithm that dramatically reduces inter-accelerator communication requirements during neural network training by decoupling momentum updates across devices, while achieving performance equal to or better than AdamW without requiring expensive high-speed interconnects. And that's a wrap! Catch you on the flip side"

"Open-Source Debates, Storage Options, & the Python Dependency Mess","View this post on the web at Welcome to HackerPulse Dispatch, your weekly newsletter comprising a hand-picked selection of the latest tech news and key developments with links! From governance struggles in open-source projects to the exploration of the pros and cons of modern browser storage solutions and the latest controversies, these stories reveal the ongoing challenges and innovations in the tech industry. Heres what new: Redis Is Trying to Take over the All the OSS Redis Libraries: Uncover the community debates over governance, trademarks, and open development sparked by Redis Inc.'s efforts to assert control over key OSS Redis libraries, including redis-rs. Deno v. Oracle: Canceling the JavaScript Trademark: Did you know that Deno has filed a USPTO petition to cancel Oracles JavaScript trademark, aiming to free the term for public use and eliminate legal barriers for the global developer community? LocalStorage vs. IndexedDB vs. Cookies vs. OPFS vs. WASM-SQLite: Unlock various browser storage options, from basic cookies and localStorage to IndexedDB, OPFS, and WASM SQLite, each suited to different needs for performance and data handling. Why Did Windows 95 Setup Use Three Operating Systems?: Windows 95 setup used a multi-stage process with three programs to handle upgrades from MS-DOS, Windows 3.1, or Windows 95, allowing for code reusability and reducing redundancy. Python Dependency Management Is a Dumpster Fire: Learn about the challenges in Python's dependency management system and discover why a comprehensive overhaul is needed to simplify and improve its reliability. Redis Is Trying to Take over the All the OSS Redis Libraries ( Read Paper ) Redis Inc. has sparked significant conversation in the open-source community as it asserts more control over Redis client libraries across various languages. Following recent acquisitions of Python and Go libraries, attention has now shifted to Rusts most popular Redis library, redis-rs. A detailed discussion between Redis representatives and the library's maintainers has raised concerns about trademark issues, long-term governance, and potential conflicts of interest. This move underscores Redis Inc.'s broader strategy to align client libraries with its commercial goals, leaving maintainers and users pondering the future of open collaboration. Key Points Redis Inc.'s push for control: Redis Inc. has proposed taking over redis-rs through options like a buyout, rebranding due to alleged trademark concerns, or ongoing maintenance under Rediss governance. However, maintainers argue that Redis lacks the Rust proficiency and resources to support the library effectively. Community-driven vs. corporate-managed libraries: Contributors and users fear a conflict between Redis Inc.s control ambitions and the communitys open governance ethos. Some maintainers suggest renaming the library or creating forks to preserve independence, while others advocate for direct contributions from Redis to build trust. Broader implications for open source: Redis Inc.'s actions highlight tensions between OSS principles and corporate interests. While the company frames its involvement as a way to ensure compatibility and innovation, critics argue that such moves risk eroding community trust and creating dependency on a single corporate entity. Deno v. Oracle: Canceling the JavaScript Trademark ( Read Paper ) On November 22, 2024, Deno officially filed a petition with the USPTO to cancel Oracle's trademark for JavaScript, aiming to liberate the term for universal public use. This action has the potential to remove long-standing legal hurdles, allowing developers and communities to use the name without fear of infringement. If successful, the move could simplify naming conventions for conferences, specifications, and community groups, replacing ECMAScript and JSConf with straightforward, widely understood terms. With Oracles response deadline set for January 4, 2025, the outcome could reshape how this essential programming language is recognized worldwide. Key Points JavaScript is a generic term: Deno argues that JavaScript is the universal name for the programming language used by millions, independent of Oracle. Trademarks that become generic cannot remain legally valid, making Oracles claim unenforceable. Oracles alleged fraud: The petition accuses Oracle of submitting false evidence to renew the trademark in 2019. By presenting unrelated projects like Node.js as proof of usage, Oracle misled the USPTO. The trademark has been abandoned: Oracle has not actively used the JavaScript trademark in commerce for years. U.S. law considers trademarks unused for three consecutive years as abandoned, and Oracles actions meet this threshold. LocalStorage vs. IndexedDB vs. Cookies vs. OPFS vs. WASM-SQLite ( Read Paper ) Web development has evolved, and so have browser storage options. From the humble days of cookies to todays advanced storage APIs, developers now have a variety of tools to store data directly in a user's browser. Whether you're building offline-first apps or need ultra-fast interactions, understanding the strengths and limits of these options is crucial. This guide dives into traditional methods like Cookies, IndexedDB, and localStorage, alongside cutting-edge solutions like OPFS and SQLite via WebAssembly. Lets break down the best options for your next project. Key Points Cookies and localStorage: Cookies are ideal for small key-value pairs but have strict size and security limitations, while localStorage offers simplicity for persisting up to 5MB of data but blocks the main thread during operations. IndexedDB and OPFS: IndexedDB supports large, structured JSON data and indexes for fast querying, while OPFS shines with its binary data handling and WebWorker compatibility for performance. WASM SQLite: This high-performance option brings server-grade SQL databases to browsers via WebAssembly, though its setup and size overhead may not suit every use case. Why Did Windows 95 Setup Use Three Operating Systems? ( Read Paper ) In a Twitter discussion, user tthirtle asked why Windows 95 setup involved three operating systemsMS-DOS, Windows 3.1, and Windows 95when it could have gone directly from MS-DOS to Windows 95. The answer lies in the complexity of handling different upgrade scenarios, and the solution was to use a multi-step setup process with distinct stages for each starting platform. Key Points Three setup programs: Windows 95 setup required three different programs for installations from MS-DOS, Windows 3.1, or an existing Windows 95 system. This approach allowed for code reuse, avoiding the need to create separate setups for each scenario. Multi-stage setup: To avoid creating three separate programs, the solution involved using a single setup with different stages: starting with a minimal version of Windows 3.1, then transitioning to a 16-bit GUI setup, and finishing with a 32-bit Windows 95 application. Code reusability: The process relied on code that was shared across all three stages, ensuring that hardware detection, file copying, and driver installation were implemented only once, significantly reducing redundancy. Python Dependency Management Is a Dumpster Fire ( Read Paper ) Niels Cautaerts critiques Python's dependency management system, labeling it as chaotic and inefficient. The article explores the complexity and confusion around managing dependencies in Python, with emphasis on how the ecosystem's tools, like pip and virtualenv, often fail to address core issues. The challenges developers face with dependency conflicts, inconsistent environments, and the lack of a unified solution are highlighted. Key Points Compilation speed benchmarks: Direct compilation of Java code is lightning fast, achieving over 100,000 lines per second with a warmed-up compiler. For example, Mockito-Core compiled in 359ms (116k lines/s) and Netty-Common in 285ms (104k lines/s). Build tool inefficiencies: Tools like Maven and Gradle perform slower due to added overhead, with Maven reducing lines/second to 6,100 and Gradle to 9,400, compared to direct compilation. Room for improvement: While Mill performed better among build tools (26k-34k lines/s), the gap between direct compilation and tool-assisted builds highlights the untapped potential for optimizing Java build systems. And that's a wrap! Catch you on the flip side"

"Exploring AI Vulnerabilities, Biometrics, and LLM-Driven Agents","View this post on the web at Welcome to this weeks AI Fridays, where we uncover the hidden challenges and groundbreaking innovations shaping the future of artificial intelligence. Discover a comprehensive survey on red teaming for generative AI, the surprising potential of footstep biometrics, and the risks of algorithmic collusion in LLMs. We also dive into the limits of inference scaling with resampling and the rise of GUI automation agents powered by LLMs. Heres whats new: Red Teaming for Generative AI: A deep dive into vulnerabilities, defenses, and emerging risks in generative models. Footstep Biometrics: Using unique frequency patterns to identify individuals with promising but evolving accuracy. LLM Collusion Risks: How AI pricing agents could unintentionally foster market collusion, sparking regulatory challenges. Inference Scaling Limits: Why resampling weaker LLMs wont close the gap with stronger models. LLM-Driven GUI Agents: A survey on how LLMs are transforming GUI automation with natural language understanding. Against The Achilles' Heel: A Survey on Red Teaming for Generative Models ( Read the Paper ) This comprehensive survey organizes red teaming approaches for generative AI models into a novel taxonomy, introduces a unified searcher framework for automated testing, and examines emerging challenges like multimodal attacks and agent-based risks, while analyzing over 120 papers to provide a holistic view of vulnerabilities and defensive strategies. Footstep recognition as people identification: A Systematic literature review ( Read the Paper ) This systematic review examines footstep recognition biometrics from 2006-2018, revealing that unique frequency patterns in footstep sounds and vibrations can identify individuals, though accuracy could be improved through multi-sensor fusion and enhanced data processing methods. Algorithmic Collusion by Large Language Models ( Read the Paper ) LLM-based pricing agents demonstrate strong pricing capabilities but can autonomously develop collusive behaviors in market settings, with even minor prompt variations potentially increasing collusion risk - raising significant regulatory challenges for AI-driven pricing systems. Inference Scaling scriptsizemathttFLaws: The Limits of LLM Resampling with Imperfect Verifiers ( Read the Paper ) Inference scaling via resampling cannot enable weaker language models to match stronger ones due to the inherent limitations of imperfect verifiers (like unit tests), which allow false positives to slip through, creating an insurmountable accuracy ceiling that persists even with infinite sampling; this challenges the hope that simple resampling strategies could level the playing field between models of different capabilities. Large Language Model-Brained GUI Agents: A Survey ( Read the Paper ) Large Language Models (LLMs) are enabling a new generation of GUI automation agents that can understand and execute complex user instructions through natural language, with this survey comprehensively analyzing their frameworks, training approaches, evaluation methods, and future research directions. And that's a wrap! Stay tuned and be the first to discover the top tech news & innovations."

"Delegacifying Code, C in Turmoil, & Resolving OOM Errors","View this post on the web at Welcome to HackerPulse Dispatch, your go-to source for the latest in tech and development! From tackling legacy system issues and navigating Cs growing divide, to optimizing Go memory leaks and improving Java build speeds, this issue offers fresh insights into tackling common challenges and enhancing workflows. Heres what new: Legacy Shmegacy: Learn about another way of tackling the legacy problemits not about the code but the lack of understanding, communication, and ownership. The Two Factions of C The once-shared vision of a unified, dialect-free C seems more like a relic of the past, as it faces mounting challenges over backward compatibility, government warnings, and a divide between modern and legacy users threatening its unity and future relevance. Investigating Golang Memory Leak with Pprof Unlock how Groundcover resolved OOM errors in its Go service by using Pprof to uncover a caching issue caused by inefficient string slicing in a Prometheus parser. How I Use Git Worktrees Did you know Git worktrees can be used not just for branch management but also to streamline concurrent workflows like coding, reviewing, testing, and quick fixes? How Fast Does Java Compile? Did you know that Java's compiler can now compile over 100,000 lines of code per second, but build tools like Gradle and Maven add significant overhead, slowing down the process? Legacy Shmegacy ( Read the Story ) Legacy code has become a scapegoat in software engineering, but the real issue often lies elsewhere: with the people who create, maintain, and label it. Legacy is less about outdated code and more about the lack of understanding and care passed between engineers. This toxic labeling leads to a cycle of rewrites and wasted resources, but it doesnt have to be that way. By fostering better communication, clearer coding practices, and a culture of ownership, teams can break free of this pattern. The solution is simpler than we thinkchange the way we look at legacy, and it changes how we handle it. Key Points Why code gets labeled legacy: Code often becomes ""legacy"" because its original authors leave or others don't understand itnot necessarily because it's outdated or low quality. A well-documented, clear codebase shared through pairing or reviews is less likely to earn this label. How to avoid creating legacy: Writing transferable code, prioritizing simplicity, and resisting the allure of trendy technologies prevents legacy systems. True innovation solves problems rather than introduces unnecessary complexity. Fixing legacy systems: Delegacifyingunderstanding and improving existing systemsis usually better than rewriting. While rewrites may occasionally be needed, only a deep understanding of the current system can justify them. The Two Factions of C ( Read the Story ) The once-shared vision of a unified, dialect-free C seems more like a relic of the past as the language faces growing internal and external challenges. Heated debates rage within the C standards committee, on forums like Reddit and Hacker News, and among corporations grappling with the trade-offs between innovation and legacy support. As the U.S. government increasingly pushes for memory-safe languages like Rust, and tech giants like Google and Microsoft pivot to alternatives, C finds itself at a crossroads. Key Points C standards double down on the old ways: The Evolution Working Group has affirmed its commitment to backward compatibility, rejecting major changes like ABI breaks or the adoption of viral annotations. Critics argue this approach locks the language into conflicting priorities, hindering meaningful modernization. Government and industry drift away: U.S. agencies like the NSA and CISA actively warn against using C, while companies such as Google, Microsoft, and AWS invest heavily in Rust. Even Google is exploring a successor language to address its dissatisfaction with C's evolution. A rift between two C cultures: A growing divide exists between ""modern"" tech-savvy users with advanced tooling and legacy users stuck in outdated workflows. This conflict over prioritiesbackward compatibility versus innovationthreatens the languages future cohesion. Investigating Golang Memory Leak with Pprof ( Read the Story ) Memory leaks: the words alone can spark frustration among developers, and for good reason. Groundcover recently faced such an issue, with one of their core services repeatedly hitting out-of-memory (OOM) errors during normal operation. The culprit? A memory leak that left the team puzzled, even in a garbage-collected language like Go. With no obvious leads, they turned to Pprof, a built-in Go profiling tool, to track down the bugand learned some valuable lessons along the way. Key Points Identifying the issue: The service was steadily accumulating memory until it hit the set limit and crashed. Initial analysis pointed to a specific function, MetricsFetcher.parseContainerMetricsResponse, responsible for the memory allocation. Digging deeper with Pprof: By examining memory profiles and call graphs, the team traced the problem to a caching mechanism storing slices of large responses instead of just small container IDscausing massive memory retention over time. The fix and insights: Modifying the caching behavior resolved the issue. The root cause was an efficient but unintuitive string slicing approach by a Prometheus parser, which avoided copying data but inadvertently locked entire responses in memory. How I Use Git Worktrees ( Read the Story ) Git worktrees offer a unique way to manage concurrent activities, moving beyond their common use as branch substitutes. By enabling simultaneous workflows across multiple directories, developers can streamline context switching without relying on features like stashing or staging. This approach reimagines Git as a toolbox for building workflows tailored to individual coding styles. Key Points Traditional vs. multitasking use: Unlike the typical use of worktrees for switching branches, the new approach assigns worktrees to specific tasks, such as coding, reviewing, and testing, allowing seamless task management. Examples of workflow: A developer might use separate worktrees for coding (e.g., implementing a new feature), reviewing others' code, running long fuzzing tests, and making quick fixes, all without disrupting each other. Detached head state advantage: Leveraging the detached head state ensures each worktree operates independently, enabling clean histories and reducing conflicts in concurrent tasks. How Fast Does Java Compile? ( Read the Story ) Javas reputation for slow compilation is outdated. The modern Java compiler (javac) can process over 100,000 lines of code per second on a single core. This speed means even large projects compile quickly in a direct setup, but using typical build tools like Gradle or Maven introduces significant overhead, slowing down the process considerably. Key Points Compilation speed benchmarks: Direct compilation of Java code is lightning fast, achieving over 100,000 lines per second with a warmed-up compiler. For example, Mockito-Core compiled in 359ms (116k lines/s) and Netty-Common in 285ms (104k lines/s). Build tool inefficiencies: Tools like Maven and Gradle perform slower due to added overhead, with Maven reducing lines/second to 6,100 and Gradle to 9,400, compared to direct compilation. Room for improvement: While Mill performed better among build tools (26k-34k lines/s), the gap between direct compilation and tool-assisted builds highlights the untapped potential for optimizing Java build systems. And that's a wrap! Stay tuned and be the first to discover the top tech news & innovations."

"Unveiling Backdoors, Optimized LLMs, and Spurious Patterns in AI","View this post on the web at Welcome to this weeks AI Fridays. This edition uncovers how backdoors can be stealthily implanted in ML models, the use of LLMs for hyperparameter optimization, and a new approach to parameter-efficient knowledge distillation. We also dive into the concept of ""super weights"" critical to LLM performance and explore the many dimensions of spuriousness in machine learning. Heres whats new: Undetectable Backdoors: Learn how malicious actors can plant stealth backdoors in ML models, evading detection while enabling targeted misclassification. LLMs for Hyperparameter Optimization: Discover how LLMs refine configurations and even treat model code as a tunable hyperparameter. LLM-Neo: A parameter-efficient method for distilling large language models into smaller, high-performance variants with minimal overhead. Super Weight in LLMs: Uncover the critical role of individual ""super weight"" parameters in maintaining LLM performance and advancing model compression techniques. Dimensions of Spuriousness: Delve into the broader implications of spurious correlations for building responsible AI systems. Planting Undetectable Backdoors in Machine Learning Models ( Read the Paper ) This work demonstrates how malicious actors can insert undetectable backdoors into machine learning models that appear normal but allow targeted misclassification, with significant implications for both model security and the theoretical foundations of adversarial robustness certification. Using Large Language Models for Hyperparameter Optimization ( Read the Story ) LLMs can match or exceed traditional hyperparameter optimization methods within constrained search budgets by suggesting and iteratively refining configurations based on model descriptions and performance feedback, while also enabling novel capabilities like treating model code itself as a tunable hyperparameter. LLM-Neo: Parameter Efficient Knowledge Distillation for Large Language Models ( Read the Story ) LLM-Neo combines low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with knowledge distillation to efficiently transfer knowledge from large language models to smaller ones, demonstrating superior performance over baseline methods when compressing Llama models while requiring minimal additional parameters. The Super Weight in Large Language Models ( Read the Story ) The study reveals that individual ""super weight"" parameters in Large Language Models can be catastrophically important - with even a single parameter's removal capable of destroying model performance - and leverages this finding to develop improved methods for model quantization and compression that specifically preserve these critical weights. The Multiple Dimensions of Spuriousness in Machine Learning ( Read the Story ) Machine learning's foundational reliance on learning correlations from data encompasses multiple dimensions of potential spuriousness (relevance, generalizability, human-likeness, and harmfulness) that go beyond simple causal/non-causal relationships, with significant implications for responsible AI development and deployment.

Poor data cleansing & high costs sink 98% of machine learning projects,"View this post on the web at Welcome to HackerPulse Dispatch, your weekly newsletter that curates the most valuable and relevant developments in the tech world. Heres what new: The Case of a Program That Crashed on Its First Instruction Lets dive into the case of a program crash on its very first instruction, where a tangled web of threads, suspicious memory writes, and an infinite loop reveal clues of potential code injection. 98% of Companies Experienced ML Project Failures Last Year, With Poor Data Cleansing and Lackluster Cost-Performance the Primary Causes Explore how companies are grappling with bill shock in data analytics and ML, facing costly trade-offs that impact project volume, query complexity, and the need for affordable solutions to drive better outcomes. Hundreds of Code Libraries Posted to NPM Try to Install Malware on Dev Machines Learn about new supply chain attacks on the NPM repository and stay vigilant by verifying package names before installation. Intel Spots a 3888.9% Performance Improvement in the Linux Kernel From One Line of Code Intels Linux kernel test robot has identified a 3888.9% performance increase due to a single-line patch optimizing THP alignment, which corrects previous memory fragmentation issues and boosts specialized workloads. How Google Ads Was Able to Support 4.77 Billion Users With a SQL Database Discover how Googles revolutionary Spanner database transformed data management powering its multi-billion dollar AD empire. The Case of a Program That Crashed on Its First Instruction ( Read the Story ) It was one of those debugging mysteries: a customers program seemed to crash right from its first instruction, and the crash report was baffling. The debugger didnt even know what went wrong, spitting out cryptic errors and warnings about untraceable threads and inaccessible commands. The investigation led to thread 1, which was attempting to write to a read-only memory region a suspicious action that hinted at an access violation. This odd behavior continued in an infinite loop, suggesting something potentially malicious or deeply flawed in the code execution. Key Points Initial mystery: The crash dump showed errors on the first instruction, with the debugger failing to identify the problem, citing inaccessible threads and exceptions. Suspicious write: Thread 1 was writing to a read-only memory region, potentially attempting to alter the programs image header, leading to an access violation. Infinite loop reveal: Further analysis uncovered that one thread was stuck in an infinite loop, repeatedly calling a mystery function with another thread merely waiting in Sleep mode, possibly indicating a flaw or malicious behavior. 98% of Companies Experienced ML Project Failures Last Year, With Poor Data Cleansing & Lackluster Cost-Performance the Primary Causes ( Read the Story ) Companies are feeling the squeeze of escalating costs in data analytics and machine learning (ML) projects, with many experiencing frequent bill shock due to unforeseen cloud expenses. The impact of these costs is leading to tough trade-offs, with organizations often forced to limit their query complexity or project volume to stay within budget. A recent survey reveals that nearly all companies face challenges from both high analytics costs and frequent ML project failures, highlighting a widespread need for more efficient resource management. Additionally, many organizations are turning to hardware solutions, with a growing emphasis on GPU instances, to handle complex, compute-heavy analytics tasks. Key Points Analytics bill shock: 71% of companies are surprised by their cloud analytics costs quarterly or more often, with some experiencing unexpected expenses every month. High costs of ML experimentation: 41% of organizations cite the high costs of ML experimentation as their biggest hurdle, suggesting that affordable, high-speed platforms could improve ROI. Compromises on query complexity: To control costs, nearly half of companies are reducing the complexity of their queries and the volume of projects, affecting the quality and timeliness of their data-driven insights. Hundreds of Code Libraries Posted to NPM Try to Install Malware on Dev Machines ( Read the Story ) A recent campaign has emerged targeting the Node Package Manager (NPM) repository, flooding it with malicious packages disguised as legitimate code libraries like Puppeteer and Bignum.js. This attack, discovered by security firm Phylum, underscores the ongoing threat of supply chain attacks aimed at developers. By leveraging Ethereums blockchain, the attackers use a unique technique to hide their IP addresses, yet ironically leave a digital trail for researchers to track their activity. As supply chain attacks remain a prominent threat, developers should stay vigilant and verify package names before installation. Key Points Novel concealment tactic: Attackers used Ethereums smart contracts to store IP addresses, enabling hidden but traceable paths for the malwares secondary payloads. Typosquatting traps: Malicious packages mimic legitimate libraries with subtle misspellings, hoping to exploit developers who might overlook small typos. Protective measures: Phylum has shared detailed indicators, including IPs and hashes, for developers to cross-reference against potentially harmful packages. Intel Spots a 3888.9% Performance Improvement in the Linux Kernel From One Line of Code ( Read the Story ) Intels Linux kernel test robot has flagged an extraordinary 3888.9% performance boost in the mainline Linux kernel this past week, thanks to a patch that limits transparent huge page (THP) alignment for specific anonymous mappings. The reported uplift is based on Intels ""will-it-scale"" scalability test on an Intel Xeon Platinum server, showcasing the potential for THP optimizations to correct past performance regressions while driving notable gains. Key Points Background on the patch: The massive improvement stems from a single-line patch that adjusts THP alignment conditions, correcting previous performance setbacks and optimizing memory access for specialized cases. Impact on workloads: The update specifically aids in reducing fragmentation in memory mappings, resolving up to 600% slowdowns reported in benchmarks like cactusBSSN and improving performance in applications such as Darktable. Intels kernel test robot role: Intels automated testing resources continue to be pivotal in catching both regressions and enhancements in kernel updates, contributing to the reliability and performance of Linux on Intel hardware. How Google Ads Was Able to Support 4.77 Billion Users With a SQL Database ( Read the Story ) Googles journey from a university project to a global tech giant involved overcoming major data challenges. Initially storing ad data in MySQL, Google scaled quickly but ran into issues with MySQL partitioning, which couldnt keep up with their explosive growth. To address their needs for both NoSQL-level scalability and ACID compliance, Google developed Spanner, a distributed SQL database with groundbreaking architecture. Heres a look at the key innovations that make Spanner a powerful and resilient database solution for massive-scale data: Key Points Atomicity with two-phase commit: To ensure transactions are all-or-nothing, Spanner uses a two-phase commit (2PC) protocol, where a coordinator checks if all partitions are ready to commit, ensuring atomic updates across the database. Global consistency with TrueTime and Paxos: By synchronizing timestamps through GPS and atomic clocks (TrueTime) and coordinating writes with the Paxos algorithm, Spanner achieves strong consistency, so data appears the same regardless of geographical location. Isolation and durability: Spanner uses two-phase locking for data isolation and synchronous writes via Paxos for durability, separating compute and storage to maintain data even in case of failure, ensuring 99.999% availability for Googles critical ad services. And that's a wrap! Stay tuned for the top tech developments of next week."

"AI Grandmaster, Pattern Recognition, Pruning, and Open-Source Innovation","View this post on the web at Welcome to your weekly AI Fridays, where we uncover the latest in artificial intelligence and machine learning! Each week, we bring you curated research that sheds light on recent advancements and intriguing applications. Heres whats new: Amortized Planning with Large-Scale Transformers: A chess-focused study shows how transformers achieve grandmaster performance without traditional search, relying on pattern recognition alone. Transformers in Chart Understanding: Dive into how transformers are transforming chart interpretation and the hurdles that remain. Efficient Text Encoders: Learn how large language models may be overly complex and benefit from targeted pruning. Inspos Crowd & AI Synergy: Insights into balancing human and AI collaboration in writing. Allegro for Open-Source Video: A new model rivaling commercial video generation tools, with transparency in training and architecture. Amortized Planning with Large-Scale Transformers: A Case Study on Chess ( Read the Paper ) A large-scale transformer model trained on ChessBench (a new 10M-game dataset) achieves grandmaster-level chess performance through pure pattern recognition without explicit search, demonstrating that complex planning tasks can be effectively learned through direct supervised learning from expert demonstrations. Transformers Utilization in Chart Understanding: A Review of Recent Advances & Future Trends ( Read the Paper ) This systematic review analyzes 32 studies to demonstrate how transformer architectures have revolutionized chart understanding tasks through end-to-end solutions, while highlighting persistent challenges in OCR dependency and visual reasoning that need to be addressed for further advancement in the field. Large Language Models Are Overparameterized Text Encoders ( Read the Paper ) LLMs can be significantly pruned (up to 30% of layers with minimal impact, and up to 80% with modest performance drop) during the fine-tuning process for text embedding tasks, demonstrating they are substantially overparameterized and can be made more efficient through a simple layer-pruning approach called LPrune. Inspo: Writing with Crowds Alongside AI ( Read the Paper ) An experimental study comparing writers' interactions with AI versus crowd worker assistants found that participants increasingly favored AI assistance due to speed and consistency, though this suggests a need for future systems that better balance and leverage the distinct strengths of both human and AI collaborators in creative writing. Allegro: Open the Black Box of Commercial-Level Video Generation Model ( Read the Paper ) Allegro represents a breakthrough in open-source video generation by revealing the technical components needed for commercial-level performance, achieving quality and temporal consistency that rivals leading proprietary models while providing transparent access to its architecture, training methodology, and implementation details. And that's a wrap. Catch you next week for the latest in AI!"

Bugs in Zendesk & FlyCASS: Security Gaps from Fortune 500 to Flight 101,"View this post on the web at Before we dive in - our friends at LastMinute, an AI healthcare startup, are on the lookout for remote software engineers proficient in TypeScript; experience with Svelte is a plus. Interested? Welcome to HackerPulse Dispatch, your weekly slice of the exclusive insights and latest updates in the tech world! Immerse yourself in the tech universe, with the most important news and cutting-edge innovations condensed into easy-to-skim bullet points, so you can stay informed in minutes. Heres what new: The Art of Programming and Why I Wont Use LLM: Did you know some devs see coding as an art form, making the rise of LLM-powered automation feel like a loss of creative joy? That's Not an Abstraction, That's Just a Layer of Indirection: Explore how overusing abstractions in code can add hidden complexity, slow performance, and shift the burden to future developers. 1 Bug, 50,000 in Bounties, How Zendesk Intentionally Left a Backdoor in Hundreds of Fortune 500 Companies: Meet Daniel, a 15-year-old programmer who discovered a critical vulnerability in Zendesk, exposing security gaps that could impact over half of the Fortune 500 companies. Bypassing Airport Security via SQL Injection: Unveil the shocking discovery of how a small SQL injection flaw in FlyCASS allowed unauthorized access to airline security systems, exposing critical vulnerabilities in aviation safety. The Disappearance of an Internet Domain:Explore how the unexpected digital ramifications of the British government's transfer of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius brings about the impending loss of the .io domain suffix. The Art of Programming and Why I Wont Use LLM ( Read the Story ) As LLMs continue making waves in the coding world, many devs have embraced them, praising the productivity boost and ease of use they provide. However, not everyone feels the same some believe the hype around these tools is exaggerated and that they take away the joy inherent in programming. For those who see coding as a deeply creative process, the idea of automating parts of it can feel like stripping away the very soul of the craft. The conversation reflects a growing divide: is coding just about outcomes, or is the process itself an art form to be cherished? Key Points The art of programming: Programming is more than solving problemsits a form of personal expression, much like creating art, with limitless ways to approach and solve any challenge. Programming as passion: Some developers find fulfillment in the act of coding itself, seeing it as an essential way to express creativity, rather than just a means to an end. That's Not an Abstraction, That's Just a Layer of Indirection ( Read the Story ) If you've ever tried optimizing or refactoring software, youve likely encountered the frustration of abstraction-heavy codebases. These systems, designed to be modular and neat, often hide layers of unnecessary indirection that slow performance and make debugging a nightmare. Key Points What makes a good abstraction: Effective abstractions hide complexity by taking on difficult tasks, like how TCP simplifies networking by handling error correction and packet sequencing. Bad abstractions as indirection: Some so-called abstractions add only extra layers without real benefit, increasing cognitive load and making systems harder to trace and debug. The hidden costs of abstraction: While abstractions offer flexibility upfront, they introduce long-term complexity and performance overhead, often leaving future developers to deal with the consequences. 1 Bug, 50,000 in Bounties, How Zendesk Intentionally Left a Backdoor in Hundreds of Fortune 500 Companies ( Read the Story ) If you think bug hunting is just for professionals, meet Daniela 15-year-old programmer who discovered a vulnerability affecting over half of the Fortune 500 companies. His target? Zendesk, a customer service platform trusted by top organizations like Cloudflare. Daniel uncovered a critical flaw in Zendesks handling of email spoofing, allowing attackers to access sensitive support tickets. His journey through corporate security loopholes revealed how interconnected systems like Zendesk and Slack can create unforeseen risks. Key Points Email spoofing vulnerability: Zendesk's flawed ticket collaboration feature allowed attackers to join active support conversations by spoofing emails, exposing companies to unauthorized access. HackerOne rejection: Daniels report was initially dismissed as ""out of scope,"" frustrating him but highlighting how bug bounty programs can miss critical security flaws. Slack takeover potential: Inspired by a 2017 exploit, Daniel realized the bug could escalate into a Slack workspace breach through OAuth loopholes in Google and Apple login systems Bypassing Airport Security via SQL Injection? ( Read the Story ) Airport security is a familiar hassle, but for pilots and flight attendants, programs like Known Crewmember (KCM) and the Cockpit Access Security System (CASS) offer fast-tracked access. These systems rely on airlines verifying employment status, ensuring only authorized personnel bypass security and access jumpseats in cockpits. But what happens when a small SQL injection flaw opens the door to bypassing these safeguards entirely? Thats exactly what two security researchers discovered, revealing severe vulnerabilities in a platform that many smaller airlines use. Key Points FlyCASS vulnerability: Researchers found FlyCASS, a system some airlines use to manage KCM/CASS authorization, had an SQL injection flaw that allowed unauthorized access to add or edit employees with no further verification. Disclosure gone wrong: Despite reporting the vulnerability to the Department of Homeland Security, communication faltered, and TSA issued incorrect statements downplaying the risks. The incident raises serious concerns about aviation security and proper vulnerability management. The Disappearance of an Internet Domain (Read the Story ) In a recent revelation, Gareth Edwards highlights the unforeseen repercussions of geopolitical changes on the digital landscape, particularly following the British government's transfer of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. This decision marks the impending end of the widely-used .io domain suffix, which has become integral to the tech and gaming industries. Drawing on historical examples like the fall of the Soviet Union and the breakup of Yugoslavia, Gareth underscores the critical intersection between international relations and internet infrastructure, offering valuable insights for tech founders and users alike. Key Points Sovereignty shift: The British governments transfer of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius will lead to the loss of the .io domain, a favorite among tech startups and gaming sites. Historical context: Past geopolitical events, such as the USSR's collapse and the disintegration of Yugoslavia, provide important lessons on how changes in national status can directly impact digital domains. Future implications: The IANA's strict rules regarding top-level domain expiration mean that once the Chagos Islands cease to exist politically, the .io domain will likely vanish, serving as a cautionary tale for tech founders about the importance of choosing the right domain suffix. And that's a wrap. Catch you next week for the latest in tech!"

Heres what new: Are Scrum Masters Too Much Overhead?: Did you know that hiring a separate Scrum Master can add unnecessary overhead, with teams potentially benefiting more by managing Scrum in the background? Are AI Coding Assistants Really Saving Developers Time? Study Suggests These Tools Dont Increase Coding Speed: The latest study on AI coding tools, reveals that while GitHub Copilot may promise productivity boosts, it actually increases bugs by 41% and fails to alleviate developer burnout. Why Do Programmers Need Private Offices With Doors?: Join us as we explore how differences between ""Harmlessly-Interruptible"" and ""Do Not Disturb"" work styles can enhance productivity and collaboration. What Is the History of the Use of Foo and Bar in Source Code Examples?: ""Foo"" and ""bar,"" originating from WWII military slang, have evolved into essential metasyntactic variables in programming, reflecting a shared linguistic tradition among developers. The Sqlite Team Is Preparing an Efficient Remote Replication Tool: Unlock SQLite, set to introduce the sqlite3-rsync utility, enabling efficient database replication and consistent snapshots while allowing active reads and writes. Are Scrum Masters Too Much Overhead? (Read the Story ) When working at start-ups or scale-ups, Maarten Dalmijn held a somewhat controversial perspective: he never wanted to hire a separate Scrum Master. The idea of bringing in someone who might add unnecessary overhead or slow down progress didnt appeal to him, even in the Netherlands, where Scrum Masters are plentiful. He preferred to keep Scrum in the background, allowing the team to focus on what truly mattered. This viewpoint was shaped by his experience playing Ultimate Frisbee, a sport with no referees where players self-governa system he believed closely mirrored how Scrum should operate. Key Points Ultimate Frisbee parallels: In Ultimate Frisbee, every player is their own referee, and the author sees Scrum teams the same way. The responsibility for understanding and enforcing the rules lies with everyone. Scrum masters as overhead: In many start-ups, hiring a Scrum Master often adds more friction than value. The team should be able to manage the process themselves. Are AI Coding Assistants Really Saving Developers Time? Study Suggests These Tools Dont Increase Coding Speed (Read the Story ) AI coding tools like GitHub Copilot have generated considerable buzz in the tech community, promising to boost developer productivity and streamline coding tasks. However, a recent study by Uplevel raises concerns about their actual impact, revealing that these tools may lead to a significant increase in bugs41% more, to be precise. The findings suggest that while developers may be working fewer hours, they are not experiencing a decrease in burnout, which challenges the notion that AI can alleviate work-related stress. With developers also spending more time reviewing AI-generated code, the anticipated efficiency gains may be far less significant than expected. Key Points Increased bugs and questionable code quality: Uplevel's study found that GitHub Copilot led to a 41% increase in bugs, with many engineering leaders now needing to implement additional safeguards to mitigate the negative impact on code quality. Minimal effect on developer burnout: Despite reduced working hours, developers using Copilot didnt experience relief from burnout, suggesting that AI coding tools arent as effective in reducing stress or workload as hoped. More time spent reviewing AI-generated code: Developers are spending more time reviewing and debugging AI-generated code, which may negate any potential time savings, casting doubt on the overall efficiency gains promised by these tools. Why Do Programmers Need Private Offices With Doors? ( Read the Story ) In modern work environments, the struggle between the need for uninterrupted focus and the demands of colleagues is all too familiar. Often, individuals find themselves deep in thought, meticulously constructing intricate mental frameworks, only to have their concentration shattered by a seemingly innocuous interruption. This conflict arises from two fundamentally different types of work: tasks that can be easily paused and resumed, and those that require sustained, deep focus. Key Points The impact of interruptions: Interruptions can severely disrupt deep focus work, likening it to a keystone arch that collapses when disturbed. This analogy highlights the significant productivity loss that can occur from even brief distractions, particularly for those engaged in complex tasks. Different work styles: The distinction between ""harmlessly-interruptible"" and ""Do Not Disturb"" work types is crucial. The former allows for easy pausing, while the latter demands continuous focus to maintain productivity. Creating a supportive environment: The author emphasizes the importance of creating workspaces that cater to both types of workers. Managers are encouraged to advocate for uninterrupted time for those who thrive on deep work, fostering an atmosphere that values both collaboration and individual concentration. What Is the History of the Use of Foo and Bar in Source Code Examples? ( Read the Story ) The terms ""foo"" and ""bar"" have become staple placeholders in programming, but their origins trace back to military slang during World War II. Derived from the acronym FUBAR, which stands for ""F-ed Up Beyond All Recognition,"" these terms reflect a culture of irony and cynicism developed among soldiers. Their widespread use has since permeated programming communities, evolving into a linguistic tradition. Key Points Military Origins: ""Foo"" and ""bar"" are linked to the military acronym FUBAR, originating during the North African and Sicilian campaigns of WWII. The terms expanded into a family of acronyms like SNAFU and JANFU, illustrating the soldiers' sense of humor amidst chaos, as highlighted in Rick Atkinson's Day of Battle. Cultural Significance: These terms were adopted by programmers as metasyntactic variablesnonsensical words used as placeholders. Their use in C/UNIX culture has endured, becoming integral to coding examples and demonstrating a shared language among developers. Historical References: While ""foo"" may have been influenced by military slang, its usage predates WWII, with references as early as the 1930s. Examples from MIT publications reveal its early adoption in programming contexts, confirming that ""foo"" and ""bar"" serve as enduring symbols in the evolution of coding language. The Sqlite Team Is Preparing an Efficient Remote Replication Tool ( Read the Story ) SQLite is preparing to roll out an exciting new feature: the sqlite3-rsync utility, which will enhance its replication capabilities. This tool aims to provide users with a consistent snapshot of their databases, even while active reads and writes are occurring. By leveraging secure SSH protocols, sqlite3-rsync will enable efficient data replication to both local and remote locations. This development not only streamlines database management but also offers new backup options for users who need timely access to their data without the overhead of locking the database. Key Points Efficient data replication: The sqlite3-rsync utility allows users to replicate an origin database to local or remote locations, utilizing SSH for secure, encrypted data transmission. The utility ensures that the target database can be read-only while maintaining live connections during replication. Snapshot limitations: While the new tool effectively captures a snapshot of the origin database at the time of invocation, any writes to the target database that are not reflected in the origin will be lost. Additionally, any new writes to the origin during replication will not be included in the snapshot. Active development and use cases: Although the sqlite3-rsync tool is still under development with no definitive release timeline, it promises a valuable solution for scenarios with high read-to-write ratios. This tool is particularly beneficial for applications requiring up-to-date yet slightly stale data without locking the database. And that's a wrap! Stay tuned and never miss a beat"

The DigitalOcean Newsletter: September 2024,"Your monthly deep dive into all things DigitalOcean, including product updates, new tutorials, upcoming events, and more. DigitalOcean logo. This image is linked to the DigitalOcean homepage. The DigitalOcean Newsletter With artificial intelligence dominating headlines, conference agendas, and product launches, it can be challenging to separate genuine innovations from overblown claims and marketing buzz. What types of AI are truly making an impact, and what's the hard truth behind the hype? Fortunately, its not all fanfare; there are very real AI use cases at work across industries and teams adopting and applying them in meaningful ways. For instance, heres what we uncovered from our latest Currents research report: 73% of respondents are currently using AI/ML tools for personal and/or business use. 78% of those surveyed anticipate an increase in their use of AI/ML this year compared to last year. 47% of businesses have implemented AI/ML in software development and coding. This data demonstrates that AI has moved beyond mere curiosity and into practical application. From open-source AI platforms to sophisticated AI software testing tools, AI applications for software development are quickly expanding. Some companies are already experimenting with AIOps, integrating AI deeply into their operations, necessitating robust AI security posture management. We're also seeing AI disrupt creative fields, tooAI design tools are changing the way designers iterate on concepts and prototypes while AI marketing tools are transforming how brands analyze customer data and tailor their messaging. All of this points to a fundamental shift: AI is changing the way we work, create, and problem-solve. The best way to grasp AI's real capabilities (and constraints) is to tinker with different tools and experiment with them in your work. By staying informed and hands-on, you'll be better positioned to use these technologies to boost productivity and work smarter. P.S.

Jobs for Junior Devs & Retaining Engineers,"View this post on the web at Welcome to HackerPulse Dispatch, your go-to newsletter covering the latest developments in the tech world, from market trends to technical developments, and expert reviews. We read the whole thing, so you dont have to! Heres whats new: Why dont tech companies pay engineers more to stay? Let's explore why paying more for keeping engineers could actually lead to long-term success. Policy: Generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT) is banned Your company needs Junior devs Hiring junior engineers isn't just about adding more handssometimes it just takes a fresh pair of eyes to see that genius is just a sticky note away. Tests and Sensibility Lets peek into the reasons proper testing is non-negotiable for ensuring the future efficiency and reliability of your code. Monorepos vs. many repos: Is there a good answer? Effective repository management, as demonstrated by Kubernetes, requires balancing the challenges of large, single repositories with the benefits of subdividing code into multiple repositories. Why dont tech companies pay engineers more to stay? ( Read Paper ) Why should companies wait for talent to leave when paying more could actually lead to long-term success? When we hear of talented actors like Reg-Jean Page leaving a hit series like Bridgerton after one season, its easy to question the studios decision. Similarly, the tech world sees engineers regularly leaving after short stints for bigger paydays. But why aren't companies offering more competitive salaries to retain this talent? Let's explore why keeping engineers is worth more than companies seem to realize. Key Points The short-sighted approach: Companies often hesitate to pay their long-tenured engineers above market rates, even though these individuals have gained valuable, company-specific domain knowledge. This short-sightedness leads to engineers leaving for external opportunities that recognize their skills better than their current employers. Valuing impact, not just tenure: Engineers increase their impact over time, particularly as they learn the intricacies of their specific company. Yet compensation structures tend to ignore this reality, failing to reward long-term employees appropriately for their unique contributions. Ethenas compensation strategy: Ethena is taking a different approach. By creating a transparent compensation formula based on impact, tenure, and performance, it ensures engineers are paid fairly and predictably. This strategy aims to retain top talent by rewarding engineers in proportion to their unique value to the company. Policy: Generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT) is banned ( Read Paper ) Stack Overflow has taken a clear stance: no content generated by AI tools, such as ChatGPT or large language models (LLMs), is allowed on the platform. While these tools may seem to generate useful responses, the reality is more complex. Here's why the ban is crucial for the platform's health. Key Points High rate of incorrect answers: AI-generated responses often appear convincing but have a high rate of inaccuracy. This creates a burden for the volunteer moderators who must review and weed out incorrect or misleading answers. Overwhelming volume of AI-created content: The ease of generating answers with AI has led to a flood of responses, overwhelming the site's quality control infrastructure. This makes it harder to ensure that users receive accurate and well-verified solutions. Enforcement and sanctions: To maintain content quality, Stack Overflow has enforced strict measures. Users caught posting AI-generated content will face sanctions, regardless of whether the posts are technically correct. Your company needs junior devs ( Read Paper ) Over coffee with local tech leaders, Doug Turnbull found himself passionately defending the value of hiring junior engineerssomething that's becoming rare in Big Tech, which prefers seasoned devs to jump into AI projects. Junior employees are like the Socrates of the officeconstantly asking why until even the most seasoned experts start doubting their own brilliance. Sure, they might crash into a few walls, but hey, one of those dumb ideas gave us Twitter... and another gave us Post-it notes. Key Points Fostering a culture of collaboration: Junior engineers require guidance, which pushes teams to teach, mentor, and share knowledge. This creates a collaborative environment where senior developers deepen their expertise by teaching, known as the Protege effect. Generalists drive innovation: Juniors, with their fresh perspectives and dumb questions, challenge assumptions that experts may overlook. History shows that some of the most innovative breakthroughs come from non-specialists, as they are more likely to try unconventional approaches. Psychological safety and innovation go hand in hand: A culture where juniors are encouraged to learn fosters psychological safety. Team members are more likely to experiment, admit mistakes, and innovate without fearkey ingredients for long-term success. Tests and Sensibility( Read Paper ) Its a truth universally acknowledged that good software should be built on solid practices. Despite this, some practices still seem to elude even seasoned developers. Just as Jane Austen might pen a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of neglecting good practices, modern developers should heed the call for thorough testing. Testing may seem like an extra step, but its essential for maintaining code quality and ensuring long-term success. Key Points Reliable Validation: Proper testing ensures that code works as intended across different environments and scenarios. Unlike one-time tests or manual checks, automated unit tests provide consistent and reproducible validation, safeguarding against future issues and reducing the risk of unexpected failures. Cost-Efficiency: Investing time in writing tests up front can save significant costs in the long run. Early detection of bugs reduces the time and resources needed for debugging and fixing issues later. Think of it as spending wisely now to avoid costly repairs and inefficiencies down the road. Code Trust and Reusability: Well-tested code builds trust within a team and enhances code reusability. Reliable components can be confidently used as building blocks for new features, minimizing the need for redundant work and reducing technical debt. Its about creating a solid foundation that others can build upon with assurance. Monorepos vs. many repos: Is there a good answer? ( Read Paper ) For teams collaborating on shared source repositories, deciding when and how to split them can be a pivotal question. The Kubernetes project has grappled with this challenge, discovering that managing repositories effectively involves various trade-offs influenced by version control systems, tooling, and development practices. Key Points Repository management challenges: Kubernetes discovered that large, single repositories can slow down workflows due to issues like slower cloning, longer build times, frequent merge conflicts, and overwhelming notifications. These problems are compounded in highly active projects, highlighting the need for effective repository management strategies. The role of Git and Git Hosting services: Gits distributed nature and its ecosystem, including platforms like GitHub and GitLab, facilitate efficient collaboration and automation through pull requests, continuous integration, and issue tracking. However, handling large repositories or multiple repositories can still pose challenges, leading to the development of tools like Prow for granular permissions and automation. And that's a wrap!

August product update: 1.6 released on Cloud and Self-hosted Init recap,"Hello, Appwriters Welcome back to the product update. Get a full recap of last month's Init and everything else that happened in August. Let's jump in! ---1.6 released Great news for all of you who cannot wait to get started with all the newly announced products and features: 1.6 is now available on Cloud and Self-hosted. Go to the Init page to find all relevant content and documentation. Or keep reading to learn more about what has been released. Visit Init ( ) ---Local development Local Development On day 0, we released Local Development, which allows you to develop and test functions on your local machine. Running functions locally has many benefits. Local development allows faster debugging, a quicker feedback loop, and a better overall experience. When running your function locally during development, you are more likely to test it every step of the way instead of shipping multiple big changes all at once. Watch the product tour for more, or visit our documentation ( ) to get started. Watch product tour ( ) ---New CLI New Appwrite CLI A good, easy-to-use CLI makes all the difference in your experience, so we're really excited to introduce a new version of the Appwrite CLI. It allows you to test your functions locally, easily migrate databases, and more. The new CLIs main features are: - Local development: Test your Appwrite function locally - Data sync: Push and pull data between Appwrite and your CLI in a non-destructive way. - Headless login: Login to your Appwrite account in a non-interactive manner for CI/CD pipelines Besides those features, this release includes many bug fixes and optimizations. Watch the product tour for more, or visit our documentation ( ) to get started. Watch product tour ( ) ---Functions ecosystem Functions ecosystem Appwrite loves Functions, so it's with great pleasure that we're introducing a host of new updates to the Functions ecosystem. - Faster Functions cold-starts - Dynamic API keys - Delayed executions - Binary executions - Execution and deployment filtering Functions are now faster, smoother, better, and more secure. Watch the product tour for more. Watch product tour ( ) ---Go support Go support We've added a Go SDK and Function runtime to allow you to take advantage of Gos speed to handle complex tasks like calculations, statistics, or file transformations more efficiently. The new runtime allowed for up to 3x faster cold starts and a base execution time of less than 1 millisecond. That means your functions will start running much quicker, and once they're up, they'll fly. What can you build with Go? Are you excited to start building with Go? Here are a few use cases to get you started: - Create APIs: Build RESTful APIs quickly and efficiently. - Process data: Handle complex data transformations and analysis. - Image processing: Resize, crop, or filter images on the fly. - File conversion: Convert files between different formats. - Machine learning: Deploy machine learning models for real-time predictions.

The F(r)ail & Error: Tech Interviews Gone Wrong,"View this post on the web at If you can develop a Python-based Slack bot that gathers and processes data using the OpenAI API, LlamaIndex/LangChain, and PostgreSQL for database management, we want to hear from you! Learn more and apply below Welcome to HackerPulse Dispatch, the weekly newsletter that curates major news, tutorials, and groundbreaking ideas in the tech ecosystem just for you! Heres what new: Using S3 but not the way you expected. S3 as strongly consistent event store: Amazon S3s new conditional writes empower developers to build robust, strongly consistent systems with ease! I will f(l)ail at your tech interviews, here's why you should care: Unlock the truth about tech interviews failing to find candidates who might be highly skilled but less adept at high-stress problem-solving. Judge dismisses majority of GitHub Copilot copyright claims: Explore the recent court ruling that has trimmed a lawsuit against GitHub, Microsoft, and OpenAI on open-source license violations and breach of contract claims. Elasticsearch is Open Source, again: Elasticsearch and Kibana are once again open source, with AGPL joining ELv2 and SSPL as license options. Using S3 but not the way you expected. S3 as strongly consistent event store? (Read the Article ) Hype often overshadows subtle yet impactful updates in the tech industry. Take Amazon S3s latest update, for exampleconditional writes have quietly become a game-changer, opening up new possibilities for developers. This update is set to redefine how we use S3 in distributed systems. Heres how this seemingly humble feature is revolutionizing cloud storage: Key Points Event Sourcing and Strong Consistency: Conditional writes allow S3 to manage concurrency control directly, enabling developers to build strongly consistent event stores without relying on external systems. Optimistic Concurrency Control Simplified: By leveraging S3s conditional writes, developers can implement optimistic concurrency without the need for complex, custom solutions, reducing operational overhead. Cost-Effective Scalability: S3s conditional writes, paired with structured naming and snapshot strategies, offer a scalable, cost-efficient solution for managing large data streams, balancing performance with cost. We need visual programming. No, not like that. ( Read the Article ) Why do most visual programming environments fail to gain traction? They often focus on replacing code syntax and business logic, which developers rarely visualize. Instead, developers are more successful when they visualize aspects like state transitions, memory layouts, and network requests. Key Points Visual Programming Gaps: Developers dont typically visualize code logic; they focus on state transitions, memory layouts, or network topologies. Practical Visualizations: Tools like DOM inspectors and flamegraphs are successful because they integrate directly into developers workflows. Room for Improvement: Visual programming environments should focus on aspects developers already visualize, rather than trying to replace code syntax. I will f(l)ail at your tech interviews, here's why you should care ( Read Article ) Technical interviews are designed to assess candidates' technical skills for specific roles, but are they really hitting the mark? Many argue that these interviews often miss the true essence of a candidates abilities, creating more false negatives than genuine insights. Lets dive into why this might be a problem for your hiring process and explore alternative approaches. Key Points The Disconnect Between Interviews and Real-World Skills: Technical interviews often focus on abstract problems, which may not reflect the actual tasks and challenges encountered in day-to-day work. Candidates who excel in interviews might not always translate that success into real-world performance. The Pressure Cooker Effect: The high-pressure environment of technical interviews can skew results, favoring candidates who perform well under stress rather than those who would be most effective in a real work setting. Alternative Approaches to Assessing Candidates: Discussing past projects or using STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) format interviews can provide more relevant insights into a candidates practical experience and problem-solving approach. Judge dismisses majority of GitHub Copilot copyright claims ( Read the Article ) In a recent legal update, judge Jon Tigar has significantly narrowed the scope of a lawsuit brought against GitHub, Microsoft, and OpenAI by developers challenging the AI-powered GitHub Copilot. Key Points Claims Cut Down: Judge Jon Tigar's ruling dismissed most of the 22 claims initially filed by developers, who alleged that GitHub Copilot unlawfully trained on their code. Only two are still active: an open-source license violation and a breach of contract. DMCA Dismissal: The court primarily rejected claims that GitHub Copilot violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) by suggesting code without proper attribution. Ongoing Legal Fight: The remaining claims concerning open-source license violations and breach of contract will continue, shedding light on the complex legal issues surrounding AI-powered coding tools and their use of existing codebases. Elasticsearch is Open Source, again ( Read the Article ) The team at Elastic is overjoyed to announce that Elasticsearch and Kibana are once again embracing their open source roots! After navigating through a period of license changes and market shifts, Elastic is thrilled to reintroduce AGPL as a license option, alongside ELv2 and SSPL. This decision marks a joyous and significant milestone for Elastic and the broader open source community. Key Points New License Options: Elastic is reintroducing AGPL as a license choice along with ELv2 and SSPL. This reaffirms its commitment to the open source community, offering users more flexibility and clarity, and ensuring that Elasticsearch and Kibana are recognized as genuine open source projects. Understanding the Shift: Elastics decision to change the license three years ago was driven by challenges with AWS and market confusion. With the landscape now stabilized, Elastic is excited to fully embrace their open source identity once again. Smooth Transition: Current users will see no changes Elasticsearch can be used as before. New users now have the option to choose AGPL. And that's a wrap! Until next time, frens"

Watch this video where I walk you through the whole process of making and submitting projects. Next, we are adding projects to Frontend and DevOps roadmaps. GIT AND GITHUB ROADMAP Git is one of the essential tools that every developer must learn. Since we recommend Git and GitHub in almost all of our roadmaps, we decided to publish two versions of this roadmap, one if you are a beginner and the other if you already know Git.

Learn GameDev by coding your own Kirby game Free 2-hour course,"Here are this week's five freeCodeCamp resources that are worth your time. Remember, if you want to keep getting these each week, you'll need to follow these quick steps: 1. Kirby is a classic Nintendo game where you control a squishy pink alien with a massive appetite. And in this freeCodeCamp course, you'll code your own version of Kirby that runs in a browser. You'll learn TypeScript a statically-typed version of JavaScript and the Kaboom.js library. This course includes all the sprite assets you'll need to build a playable platformer game that you can share with your friends. (2 hour YouTube course): 2. And if you want to learn what it's like being a professional GameDev, I interviewed Ben Awad, creator of Voidpet, which I can only describe as a sort of Emotional Support Pokmon-like mobile game. Ben is a prolific coding tutorial creator, and has a weird but popular TikTok channel as well. I had a blast learning more about his adventures over the past few years. Did you know he sleeps 9 hours every single night? He swears by it. (2 hour watch or listen in your favorite podcast app): 3. You've heard of personal portfolio websites. But what about a portfolio that runs right in a command line terminal? That's right this tutorial will teach you how to build an interactive portfolio experience, complete with ASCII art, a rsum menu, and even a joke command. You'll learn all about Shell Commands, Tab Completion, Syntax Highlighting, and more. And at the end of the day, you'll have a fun way to share your work with potential clients and employers. (35 minute read): 4. The great thing about emerging AI tools is that you don't need to be a Machine Learning Engineer with a PhD in Applied Mathematics just to be able to get things done with them. The burgeoning field of AI Engineering is essentially just web developers using AI APIs and off-the-shelf tools to power up their existing apps. We just published this course, taught by frequent freeCodeCamp contributor Tom Chant. It will introduce you to this new skill set and this new way of leveraging AI. (2 hour YouTube course): 5. What's the difference between React and Next.js? And while we're at it, what's the difference between a library and a framework? In this course, software engineer Ankita Kulkarni will explain these concepts. And she'll also teach you various data fetching mechanisms and rendering strategies. If you want to expand your understanding of Front End Development, this course is for you. (2 hour YouTube course): Again, just to 100% confirm, I'm not going to send these anymore unless you follow those quick steps above. If you're getting any value at all out of these open learning resources, the form literally takes 10 seconds to fill out. Quote of the Week: Game development is very difficult. Nobody sets out to create a game that's not fun. It's all of the challenges and difficulties that happen throughout development that determine whether a game is a failure or a success. I think playing those thousands of games is the single best and easiest way to learn from my predecessors. Masahiro Sakurai, Software Engineer, Game Developer, and Creator of Kirby Until next week, Happy coding. (But only if you fill out that form.) -- Quincy Larson Teacher and founder of freeCodeCamp.org If these aren't worth your time, you can turn them off:"

Google Podcasts is going away,"Google Podcasts Hi Ambarish, Recently, we announced that Google Podcasts will be going away this year. In order to ease this transition, you now have access to a tool that allows you to easily migrate your show subscriptions to YouTube Music or to download a file of your show subscriptions, which you can upload to an app that supports their import. Your Google Podcast data will remain available to you in Google Takeout for one year after Google Podcasts is deprecated, after which time it will be deleted. Just like Google Podcasts, with YouTube Music you can listen to podcasts on the go using background play, download podcasts and more with no paid membership required. After 23 June 2024, you will no longer be able to listen to podcasts in Google Podcasts. After 29 July 2024, you will no longer be able to migrate or export your subscriptions. Please note that in order to access the migration and export tools, you'll need to be on the latest version of the Google Search and Google Podcasts apps and have a valid account type. If you are not on a supported app version, you will only be able to access migration and export tools on the web version of Google Podcasts. Users on Android or iOS apps who have not updated to the latest app version by 29 July 2024 will be automatically redirected to the web version of Google Podcasts. Some features are not available in the web version of Google Podcasts, including downloading. If you have questions, we're here for you. Take a look at our support resources.

Your Google Play purchase verification settings,"Hi Ambarish, On Google Play, you can set biometrics (fingerprint or face) as your purchase verification method on mobile devices that have biometric capability. If you set biometrics, it means that you'll be asked to verify that it's you with biometrics each time that you make a purchase through Google Play.

For mobile devices, when you're asked to confirm this setting, you'll use your fingerprint or face instead of your Google Account password. To keep your account secure, turn on purchase verification for every purchase. Avoid sharing passwords with others. If you use biometrics for purchase verification, use caution in storing biometrics of children or others on your device, as those could be used for purchase verification.

Learn to code an AI from scratch Free 4-hour JavaScript course,"Here are this week's five freeCodeCamp resources that are worth your time: 1. In an era of powerful off-the-shelf AI tools, there's something to be said for building your own AI from scratch. And that's what you'll learn how to do in this beginner course. Dr. Radu teaches computer science at a university in Finland, and is one of freeCodeCamp's most popular instructors. He'll show you how to manually tweak neural network parameters so you can teach a car how to drive itself through a Grand Theft Auto-like sandbox playground. (4 hour YouTube course): 2. Learn how to code your own playable Super Nintendo-style developer portfolio website. Instead of just reading your rsum, visitors can walk around a Legend of Zelda-like cabin and explore your work. This tutorial includes all the sprites, tiles, and other pixel art assets you need to build the finished website. Practice your JavaScript skills while building an interactive experience you can share with friends and potential employers. (2 hour YouTube course): 3. Learn Git fundamentals. freeCodeCamp just published this new handbook that will teach you how to get things done with a version control system. You'll learn how to set up your first code repository, create branches, commit code, and push changes to production. You can code along at home with this book's many tutorials, and bookmark it for future reference. (full-length handbook): 4. Learn the latest version of the popular React Router JavaScript library. This course will teach you how to build Single Page Apps where your users can navigate from one React view to another without the page refreshing. You'll also get practice defining routes, passing parameters, and managing state transitions. (2 hour YouTube course): These are just a few of the many tutorials the freeCodeCamp community published this week. I hope you're having fun and learning a lot. And I hope you don't feel overwhelmed by all the resources I send you each week. Remember: if you just want to build your core developer skills, go through the freeCodeCamp curriculum from top to bottom: Quote of the Week: I wrote nearly a thousand computer programs while preparing this material, because I find that I don't understand things unless I try to program them. Donald Knuth on all the code he wrote from scratch in researching his classic book The Art of Computer Programming Until next week, happy coding. -- Quincy Larson Teacher and founder of freeCodeCamp.org If these aren't worth your time, you can turn them off:"

Learn to code Nest.js apps Free 12-hour course on Full-Stack JavaScript,"Here are this week's five freeCodeCamp resources that are worth your time: 1. Learn to build apps with the popular Nest.js full-stack JavaScript framework. In this intermediate course, you'll code your own back end for a Spotify-like app. You'll learn how to deploy a Node.js API to the web. And you'll build out all the necessary database and authentication features along the way. (Note that Nest.js is similar to Next.js, but Nest.js uses TypeScript and is heavily inspired by Angular. freeCodeCamp also has comprehensive Next.js courses if you want to learn that as well.) (12 hour YouTube course): 2. You may have heard the term no-code before. Essentially these types of tools are not only code because you can still write custom code to run on top of them. This said, these tools do make it dramatically easier for both developers and non-developers to get things done. This new course is taught by one of freeCodeCamp's most popular instructors, Ania Kubw. She'll teach you how to automate boring tasks by leveraging AI tools and creating efficient automation pipelines. (3 hour YouTube course): 3. Kanban task management boards were invented at Toyota way back in the 1940s. I speak Chinese and a little Japanese, and I can tell you that the Chinese characters in the word Kanban translate to look board something you can look at to quickly understand what's going on with a project. You may have used popular Kanban tools like Trello. But have you ever coded your own Kanban? Well, today's the day. This project-oriented tutorial will teach you how to use React, Next.js, Firebase, Tailwind CSS, and other modern webdev tools. (90 minute read): 4. Learn how to do hard-core data analysis and visualization using Google's stack of freely available tools: Sheets, BigQuery, Colab, and Looker Studio. This beginner-friendly course is taught by a seasoned data analyst. He'll walk you through each of these tools, and show you how to pipe your data from one place to the other. You'll walk away with insights you can apply to accomplish your practical day-to-day goals. (3 hour YouTube course): 5. In this week's episode of the freeCodeCamp Podcast, I interview Jessica Lord AKA JLord. You may not have heard of her, but you probably use her code every day. She's worked as a software engineer for more than a decade at companies like GitHub and Glitch. Among her many accomplishments, she created the Electron team at GitHub. Electron is a library for building desktop apps using browser technologies. If you've used the desktop version of Slack, Figma, or VS Code, you've used Electron. We had such a fun time talking about her journey from architecture student to city hall to working at the highest levels of tech. (2 hour watch or listen in your favorite podcast app): I've been springing out of bed every morning at like 5 a.m. because I'm so excited about the work we're doing here at freeCodeCamp. It's an absolute pleasure to share these open learning resources with you each week. A huge thank you to the 8,502 kind folks who donate each month to support our charity.

Learn to code in TypeScript Free 10-hour course on statically-typed JavaScript,"Here are this week's five freeCodeCamp resources that are worth your time: 2. On this week's podcast, I interview Phoebe Voong-Fadel about her childhood as the daughter of refugees, and how she self-studied coding and became a professional developer at the age of 36. Phoebe worked from age 12 at her parent's Chinese take-out restaurant. After college, the high cost of childcare forced her to leave her career so she could raise her two kids. After two years of teaching herself to code using freeCodeCamp, she got her first job as a developer. (1 hour listen in your browser or favorite podcast app): 3. How can two people communicate securely through an insecure channel? That is a fundamental challenge in cryptography. One approach is by using the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange algorithm. freeCodeCamp just published a handbook that will teach you how to leverage Diffie-Hellman to protect your data in transit, as it moves from between clients and servers. This handbook dives deep into the math that makes this possible, and uses tons of diagrams to explain the theory. It also explores older solutions, such as Hash-based Message Authentication Code. And you'll immediately put all this new knowledge to use by building a secure messaging project. (full-length handbook): 5. Learn Microsoft's ASP.NET web development framework by building 3 projects. You'll start off this course by learning some C and .NET fundamentals while coding a menu app. Then you'll dive into some advanced features while building your own clone of Google Docs. Finally, you'll bring everything together by building a payment app. Along the way, you'll get familiar with Microsoft's powerful Visual Studio coding environment. (2.5 hour YouTube course): These are just a few of the many open source learning resources the freeCodeCamp community published this week. I'm so jazzed about the progress we're making toward our mission. I invite you to get involved as an open source contributor as well. And even if you don't have time for that, you can still join the 8,427 kind folks who donate each month to support our charity's efforts: Quote of the Week: TypeScript is silly because it just gets turned back into typeless code when you hit compile. Oh man do I have some upsetting news about C for you. Jules Glegg, Game Developer Until next week, happy coding. -- Quincy Larson Teacher and founder of freeCodeCamp.org If these aren't worth your time, you can turn them off:"

Learn Back-end Development Free 70-hour coding course,"Here are this week's five freeCodeCamp resources that are worth your time: 1. freeCodeCamp just published a comprehensive roadmap for learning Back-End Development. You'll start off by learning full-stack JavaScript with Node.js. Then you'll learn how to use Django to build a Python back end. After building several mini-projects, you'll dive deep into database administration with SQL. You'll then build your own APIs, write tests for them, and secure them using OWASP best practices. This roadmap will also teach you Architecture and DevOps concepts, Docker, Redis, and the mighty NGINX. (70 hour roadmap of YouTube courses): 2. Learn the algorithms that come up most frequently in employers' coding interviews. This new course will teach you how to use JavaScript to solve interview questions like Spiral Matrix, the Pyramid String Pattern, and the infamous Fizz-Buzz. (2 hour YouTube course): 4. Learn how to localize your websites and apps into many world languages. Of course, anyone can just drop in a translation plugin. But if you want your users to have a good experience, you should create bespoke translations that resonate with native speakers of those languages. This course will introduce you to a powerful translation crowdsourcing tool used by many websites and apps including freeCodeCamp. You'll learn how to combine machine translation with the intuition of native speakers to quickly craft translations that sound natural. Then you'll learn how to use the front-end libraries necessary to get those translations in front of the right users. (8 hour YouTube course): Quote of the Week: In the particular is contained the universal. James Joyce, Irish novelist and poet Until next week, happy coding. -- Quincy Larson Teacher and founder of freeCodeCamp.org If these aren't worth your time, you can turn them off:"

Learn C by building projects Free 8-hour coding course,"Here are this week's five freeCodeCamp resources that are worth your time: 1. Learn the C programming language. This course will teach you C syntax, data structures, Object Oriented Programming concepts, and more. Then you'll apply this knowledge by coding a variety of mini-projects throughout the course. (8 hour YouTube course): 2. Prolific freeCodeCamp author Nathan Sebhastian just published his React for Beginners Handbook. You can read the full book and learn how to code React-powered JavaScript apps. Along the way you'll learn about Components, Props, States, Events, and even Network Requests. (full-length handbook): 3. This new Machine Learning course will give you a clear roadmap toward building your own AIs. Data Scientist Tatev Aslanyan teaches this Python course. She covers key statistical concepts like Logistic Regression, Outlier Detection, Correlation Analysis, and the Bias-Variance Trade-Off. She also shares some common career paths for working in the field of Machine Learning. (4 hour YouTube course): 4. But you don't have to learn a ton of Statistics and Machine Learning to get more out of AI. You can first focus on just getting better at talking to AI. This new Prompt Engineering Handbook will give you practical tips for getting better images, text, and code out of Large Language Models like GPT-4. (full-length handbook): 5. In this week's episode of the freeCodeCamp podcast, I interview education charity founder Seth Goldin. He's a computer science student at Yale and has taught several popular freeCodeCamp courses. We talk about the future of education, and the risks and opportunities presented by powerful AI systems like ChatGPT. During this fun, casual conversation, we make sure to explain all the specialized terminology as it comes up. And like most of our episodes, this podcast is 100% OK to listen to around kids. (2 hour listen in your browser or favorite podcast app): We're so proud to bring you all these new open learning resources each week. Our charity will continue to teach the world math, programming, computer science, and English. A big thanks to the now 8,405 kind folks who support us each month. You should join them: Joke of the Week: Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they can't C. Until next week, happy coding. -- Quincy Larson Teacher and founder of freeCodeCamp.org If these aren't worth your time, you can turn them off:"

Learn Generative AI with Python Free 30-hour course,"Here are this week's five freeCodeCamp resources that are worth your time: 1. Generative AI is a type of Artificial Intelligence that creates new content based on its training data, rather than just returning a pre-programmed response. You may have tried creating text or images using models like GPT-4, Gemini, or the open source Llama 2. But how do these models actually work? This in-depth freeCodeCamp course will teach you the underlying Machine Learning concepts that you can use to create your own models. And it'll show you how to leverage popular tools like Langchain, Vector Databases, Hugging Face, and more. (30 hour YouTube course): 2. One Generative AI model that just came out is Google's new Gemini model. And freeCodeCamp instructor Ania Kubw just finished her comprehensive course showcasing Gemini's many features. You'll learn how Gemini works under the hood, and about its ""multimodal"" functionalities like image-to-text, sound-to-text, and even text-to-video. The course culminates in grabbing an API key and coding along with Ania to build your own AI Code Buddy chatbot project. (1.5 hour YouTube course): 4. freeCodeCamp just published another full-length handbook this time on Regular Expressions. RegEx are one of the most powerful and most confusing features of modern programming languages. You can use RegEx to search through data, validate user input, and even find complex patterns within text. This handbook will teach you key concepts like anchors, grouping, metacharacters, and lookahead. And you'll learn a lot of advanced JavaScript RegEx techniques, too. (full-length handbook): 5. Serverless Architecture is a popular approach toward building apps in 2024. Despite the name, there are still servers in a data center somewhere. This isn't magic. But the tools abstract the servers away for you. In this intermediate JavaScript course, Software Engineer Justin Mitchel will teach you how to take a simple Node.js app and run it on AWS Lambda with a serverless Postgres database. He'll even show you how to automate deployment using GitHub Actions and Vercel. (4 hour YouTube course): Also, on this week's podcast I interviewed an emerging star in the Machine Learning community: Logan Kilpatrick. The day he started working at Open AI, ChatGPT was brand new and hit its first 1 million users. We talk about Logan's journey from the suburbs of Chicago to the heart of Silicon Valley, his work at NASA, and his many freeCodeCamp tutorials on the Julia programming language. (2 hour listen in your browser or favorite podcast app): The freeCodeCamp community publishes dozens of courses, tutorials, podcasts, and full-length books each week. Here I've just shared a few of them. If you ever feel like this waterfall of open source learning resources is too overwhelming, please don't fret. If you just focus your time on freeCodeCamp's core coding curriculum, you'll be set. And you can join us in our mission by supporting our charity: Quote of the Week: The plural of regex is regrets. Steve, a Brooklyn-based Golang developer and reluctant user of Regular Expressions Until next week, happy coding. -- Quincy Larson Teacher and founder of freeCodeCamp.org If these aren't worth your time, you can turn them off:"

Learn Data Structures from a Google Engineer Free 48-hour Java Course,"Here are this week's five freeCodeCamp resources that are worth your time: 1. Data Structures and Algorithms are tools that developers use to solve problems. DS&A are a huge chunk of what you learn in a computer science degree program. And they come up all the time in developer job interviews. This in-depth course is taught by a Google engineer, and will teach you the key concepts of Time Complexity, Space Complexity, and Asymptotic Notation. Then you'll get tons of practice by coding dozens of the most common DS&A using the popular Java programming language. (48 hour YouTube course): 2. Many of the recent breakthroughs in AI are thanks to advances in Deep Learning. In this intermediate-level handbook, Data Scientist Tatev Aslanyan will teach you the fundamentals of Deep Learning and Artificial Neural Networks. She'll give you a solid foundation that you can use as a springboard into the more advanced areas of machine learning. You'll learn about Optimization Algorithms, Vanishing Gradient Problems, Sequence Modeling, and more. (full-length handbook): 3. The Document Object Model (DOM) is like a big Christmas tree that you hang ornament-like HTML elements on. This front-end development handbook will teach you how the DOM works, and how you can use it to make interactive web pages. You'll learn about DOM Traversal, Class Manipulation, Event Bubbling, and other key concepts. (full-length handbook): 4. On this week's episode of the freeCodeCamp Podcast, I interview Jessica Wilkins, an orchestral musician from Los Angeles turned software engineer. We talk about how ridiculously competitive the world of classical music is, and how it gave her the mental toughness that she needed to learn to code. Jessica ultimately turned down contracts from Disney and other music industry titans so that she could focus on transitioning into tech. She was a prolific volunteer contributor to the freeCodeCamp codebase and core curriculum, and now works on our team. I think you'll dig our conversation especially if you're interested in the overlap between music and technology. (2.5 hour listen in your browser or favorite podcast app): 5. Finally, if you have Spanish-speaking friends, tell them about this new CSS Flexbox course that we just published. freeCodeCamp now has tons of courses in Spanish, along with a weekly Spanish podcast all available on our freeCodeCamp Espaol channel. (1 hour YouTube course): Quote of the Week: Less than 10% of code has to do with the ostensible purpose of a system. The rest deals with input-output, data validation, data structure maintenance, and other housekeeping. Mary Shaw, Software Engineer and Carnegie Mellon Computer Science Professor Until next week, happy coding. -- Quincy Larson Teacher and founder of freeCodeCamp.org If these aren't worth your time, you can turn them off:"

Learn how to make art with code Free 2-hour JavaScript course,"Here are this week's five freeCodeCamp resources that are worth your time: 1. Learn how to use JavaScript to create art with code. More and more contemporary artists are using math and programming to create digital art and interactive experiences. This course is taught by artist and software engineer Patt Vira. She'll show you how to use the popular p5.js library. You can code along at home and build 5 beginner art projects. (2 hour YouTube course): 2. It's hard to predict the exact order in which things will happen in life. That's certainly the case in software. Thankfully, developers have pioneered a more flexible approach called Asynchronous Programming. And JavaScript is especially well-equipped for async programming thanks to its special Promise objects. freeCodeCamp just published this JavaScript Promises handbook to teach you common async patterns. You'll also learn about error handling, promise chaining, and async anti-patterns to avoid. (full-length handbook): 3. Code your own product landing page using SveltKit. Software Engineer James McArthur will teach you all about Svelt, SveltKit, Tailwind CSS, and the benefits of Server-Side Rendering. He'll even show you how to deploy your site to the web, and add a modern CI/CD pipeline. This course will give you a good mix of theory and practice. (2 hour YouTube course): 4. Learn how to code your own video player that runs right in your browser. This in-depth tutorial will teach you how to use powerful tools like Tailwind CSS and Vite. You'll also learn some good old-fashioned JavaScript. This is an excellent project-oriented tutorial for intermediate learners. (1 hour read): 5. On this week's freeCodeCamp Podcast, I interview developer and Scrimba CEO Per Borgen. We talk about Europe's tech startup scene and the emerging field of AI Engineering. Per is a fellow founder whom I've known for nearly a decade, and we had a fun time catching up. I hope you're enjoying the podcast and learning a lot from these thoughtful devs I'm having as guests. (1 hour YouTube video or you can listen in your favorite podcast app): This week freeCodeCamp made our first new hire in over 2 years. She's a prolific open source volunteer who's made more than a hundred code contributions. Our team is now nearly half women, and we now have devs and teachers in 21 countries around the globe. All of this work is possible thanks to the 8,127 kind folks who donate each month to support our charity. If you haven't started supporting our mission yet, please consider doing so today: Quote of the Week: I think we'd all feel much better if we instead saw bad code as a form of contemporary art. Unused functions? Surrealism. Mixing tabs and spaces? Postmodern. My code isn't spaghetti, it's avant-garde. Cain Maddox, Game Developer Until next week, happy coding. -- Quincy Larson Teacher and founder of freeCodeCamp.org If these aren't worth your time, you can turn them off:"

Learn React by coding 25 projects Free 10-hour JavaScript Course,"Here are this week's five freeCodeCamp resources that are worth your time: 3. Gavin Lon has been a C developer for two decades, writing software for companies around London. And now he's distilled his C wisdom and his love of the programming language into this comprehensive book. Over the past few years, freeCodeCamp Press has published more than 100 freely available books that you can read and bookmark as a reference. And this is one of our most ambitious books. It explores C data types, operators, classes, structs, inheritance, abstraction, events, reflection, and even asynchronous programming. In short, if you want to learn C, read Gavin's book. (full-length book): 4. Roughly 1 out of every 7 Americans lives with a disability. As developers, we should keep these folks in mind when building our apps. Thankfully, there's a well-established field called Accessibility (sometimes shortened to a11y because there are 11 letters in the word that fall between the A and the Y). This nuts-and-bolts freeCodeCamp course will teach you about Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, Accessible Rich Internet Applications, Semantic HTML, and other tools for your toolbox. (2 hour YouTube course): 5. On this week's freeCodeCamp Podcast, I interview the creator of one of the most successful open source projects ever. Robby Russell first released the Oh My Zsh command line tool 15 years ago. We talk about his web development consultancy, which has built projects for Nike and other Portland-area companies. We also talk about his career-long obsession with code maintainability, and his post-rock band. (2 hour watch on YouTube, or listen in your favorite podcast app): freeCodeCamp is a charity with a simple mission: to create open source courses on math, programming, and computer science, for folks all around the world. More than a million people use freeCodeCamp every day. But as you can imagine, it costs a lot to keep our 104 servers running and our staff of 36 teachers teaching. If you have the means, please join 8,063 kind people in supporting our mission each month: Quote of the Week: I tried to teach myself to code THREE times. In 2014, in 2015, and in 2017. And all three times I quit because I tried to jump too high, set myself up for failure, and then assumed I was not smart enough. But actually, I had just tried to run before Id learned to walk. Zubin Pratap, freeCodeCamp alum who went on to become a software engineer at Google Until next week, happy coding. -- Quincy Larson Teacher and founder of freeCodeCamp.org If these aren't worth your time, you can turn them off:"

"Be Prepared to Pitch Investors Be prepared, I repeat.","Its time to take Action, now or never. Heres a Fact: According to Carta, investments were down 50%75% in 2023 compared to past years, and on average, for a good startup, it will take around 10 months to raise their round. It was just 45 months back in 2020, now startups have to be prepared more than ever before. As 2024 starts to unwrap, we wanted to emphasize the critical importance of being ready to pitch investors ( ) , especially in the ever-changing landscape of startups and technology. Fundraising for early-stage ventures can be a rollercoaster ride filled with uncertainty and risks.

How to get a coding job even in this economy Free 4-hour course,"Here are this week's five freeCodeCamp resources that are worth your time: 2. For years, people have asked for an in-depth course on Data Engineering. And I'm thrilled to say freeCodeCamp just published one, and it's a banger. Data Engineers design systems to collect, store, and analyze data systems that Data Scientists and Data Analysts rely on. This course will teach you key concepts like Data Pipelines and ETL (Extract-Transform-Load). And you'll learn how to use tools like Docker, CRON, and Apache Airflow. (3 hour YouTube course): 3. freeCodeCamp also just published a full-length book on Advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java. It will teach you Java Design Patterns, File Handling, I/O, Concurrent Data Structures, and more. And freeCodeCamp published a more beginner-friendly Java OOP book by the same author a while back, too. (full-length book): 4. freeCodeCamp uses the open source NGINX web server, and more than one third of all other websites do, too. NGINX uses an asynchronous, event-driven architecture so you can handle a ton of concurrent users with fewer servers. We just published a crash course on using NGINX for back-end development. You'll learn how to use it for load balancing, reverse proxying, data streaming, and even as a Microservice Architecture. (1 hour YouTube course): Just a reminder that freeCodeCamp is a 501(c)(3) public charity. We don't have any stock holders or investors. Even though I founded freeCodeCamp, I donated all my shares to the charity. So no one owns any equity in freeCodeCamp. Instead, we're owned by the freeCodeCamp community itself. And each month, 8,408 of those kind folks donate to support our mission. If you're able to, you should, too: Quote of the Week: Data engineers are the plumbers building a data pipeline, while data scientists are the painters and storytellers, giving the data a voice. Steven Levy, author of many excellent books about developers and tech companies Until next week, happy coding. -- Quincy Larson Teacher and founder of freeCodeCamp.org If these aren't worth your time, you can turn them off:"

Gitting Things Done with Git Free full-length coding book by a CTO,"Here are this week's five freeCodeCamp resources that are worth your time: 1. This week freeCodeCamp published a massive book on Git. Git was invented by the same programmer who created Linux. It's a powerful Version Control System that virtually all new software projects use. This said, even experienced developers can struggle to understand Git. So my friend Omer Rosenbaum the CTO of an AI company wrote this intermediate book. It will teach you how Git works under the hood, and how you can use it to collaborate with other devs around the world. (full-length book): 2. Learn Data Analysis with Python. This comprehensive course will teach you how to analyze data using Excel, SQL, and even specialized industry tools like Power BI and Tableau. Along the way, you'll improve your Python and build several real-world projects you can show off to your friends. The instructor, Alex Freberg, has worked as a data analyst in a variety of industries. He's adept at explaining advanced topics. I think you'll enjoy this course and learn a lot. (19 hour YouTube course): 4. A String is one of the most primordial of data types. You can find String variables in almost every programming language. Strings are just a sequence of characters, usually between two quote marks, like this: ""banana"". And yet there are so many things you can do with Strings: Concatenation, Comparison, Encoding, and even String Searching with Regular Expressions. Joan Ayebola wrote this in-depth handbook that will teach you everything you need to know about JavaScript Strings. (full handbook): 5. Hugging Face is not just what happens in the 1979 movie Alien. It's also a ""GitHub of AI"" platform where machine learning enthusiasts share models and datasets. This tutorial will show you how to set up the Hugging Face command line tools, browse pretrained models, and run a few AI tasks such as sentiment analysis. (20 minute read): I hope your 2024 is off to a strong start. If you want to get more serious about software development this year, you're in the right place. The freeCodeCamp community just published major updates to our core curriculum. We're working hard to ensure that anyone, anywhere in the world can learn to code regardless of their circumstances. You can support our charity and our mission today: Quote of the Week: Duct tape programmers dont give a damn what you think about them. They stick to simple, basic, and easy to use tools. Then they use the extra brain power that these tools leave them to write more useful features for their customers. Joel Spolsky, developer and founder of Stack Overflow and Trello Until next week, happy coding. -- Quincy Larson Teacher and founder of freeCodeCamp.org If these aren't worth your time, you can turn them off:"

The 100DaysOfCode challenge is an ideal New Year's Resolution for anyone wanting to expand their developer skills. Each year, thousands of ambitious people commit to this simple challenge: code at least 1 hour each day for 100 days in a row, and support other people who are doing the same. I've written this guide to how you can get started and make some serious gains in 2024.

Learn JavaScript by coding 21 projects Free 300 hour curriculum,"Here are this week's five freeCodeCamp resources that are worth your time: 1. I'm proud to announce that after 2 years of development, freeCodeCamp's new upgraded JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification is now live. You can learn JavaScript step-by-step by coding 21 different projects right in your browser. You'll build your own fantasy role playing game, mp3 player app, spreadsheet tool, and even a Pokmon Pokdex app. (300-hour interactive curriculum): 3. Learn full-stack web development with this comprehensive project-based course. You'll build and deploy your own hotel management dashboard. Along the way, you'll learn advanced tools like Next.js, React, Sanity, and Tailwind CSS. This is an excellent course to solidify your coding fundamentals. (10 hour YouTube course): 4. Figma is a popular design and app prototyping tool. And they recently introduced a powerful feature that lets you declare variables, then use them throughout your projects. A lot of designers think this is a big deal. And freeCodeCamp just published a comprehensive handbook that will teach you how to leverage these Figma variables, so you can use them in your designs. (full-length handbook): 5. On this week's freeCodeCamp Podcast, I interview Kylie Ying, a software engineer and AI researcher. We talk about her 5 years at MIT and her time at CERN working on the Large Hadron Collider. We also talk about competitive figure skating, poker-playing AIs, and the many courses she's published on freeCodeCamp over the years. (2 hour listen in your browser or favorite podcast app): This is my last subspace transmission for 2023. It has been an amazing year for the freeCodeCamp community. Our charity has made so much progress toward our vision of open learning for everyone. And yet if we had more resources, we could do even more. That is why I'm asking you to get involved by becoming a monthly supporter. Or you could give a year-end gift. I'm happy to answer any questions you may have and to send you a donation receipt so you can deduct your gift from your taxes. This will mean the world to me, to the community, and to the millions of learners around the world who benefit from our work: Joke of the Week: Why do programmers always mix up Christmas and Halloween? Because Dec 25 Oct 31. In programming, Dec stands for Decimal, meaning a base-10 number system. And Oct stands for Octal, meaning a base-8 number system. So Dec 25 really does equal Oct 31. I know this isn't the funniest programmer joke ever, but it is fun to think about. See you in 2024. -- Quincy Larson Teacher and founder of freeCodeCamp.org If these aren't worth your time, you can turn them off:"

Learn to code an entire city of self-driving cars Free 6-hour JavaScript AI course,"Here are this week's five freeCodeCamp resources that are worth your time: 1. Learn to code your own mini Grand Theft Auto game with self-driving cars. Dr. Radu Mariescu-Istodor teaches this intermediate JavaScript course. He's already taught several freeCodeCamp courses on No Black Box AI development and self-driving cars. And now he'll teach you how to build an entire virtual world and populate it with those cars. You'll learn about spatial graphs, 3D geometry, road marking recognition, and how to incorporate real-world road data from OpenStreetMap. (6 hour YouTube course): 5. Finally, I had the privilege of touring the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. And while I was there I interviewed my long-time friend and fellow founder Dhawal Shah. He has run the popular Class Central website for more than a decade, and is a historian of Massive Open Online Courses. We talk about his childhood in India, how he won his first computer from a Cartoon Network sweepstakes, and how he moved to the US as an engineer and ultimately became a US citizen. (2 hour listen in your browser or favorite podcast app): Quote of the Week: Open world games are fun not because NPCs (non-player characters) have their own stories, but because the player can affect those stories in significant ways.

Frontend to Fullstack Monthly 8: Is CSS easier to write now?,"What's new in December: Get up to speed with what's going on in front-end, Node.js and beyond. Hi Ambarish, We're back with Frontend to Fullstack Monthly 8 new courses, updates, and all the industry's latest news! Frontend Masters updates Weve been busy recording all fall and have so many awesome courses in the queue. Vite, Tailwind, Engineering Management, Blazingly fast JS, Advanced Algorithms, HTMX, Vanilla JS Projects, JavaScript quiz, new Angular fundamentals...oh my! We hired a new lead product designer and immediately started work on our new design system. Launched a new course on Building AI-Powered Apps with OpenAI and Node.js ( ) Integrate Node.js with OpenAI to build advanced AI-powered applications. Learn to build AI chat interfaces, semantic search, document QA, function calling, and create AI images! All new TypeScript courses the entire TypeScript Learning Path ( ) has been revamped! (more details on this tomorrow) 2024 planning is well underway! We scheduled 20 new workshops for 2024 so far and have posted 14 of them on the workshops page ( ). Thanks for everyone who has watched, listened and subscribed to the The Frontend Masters Podcast ( ) on Spotify ( ) , Apple Podcasts ( ) , and YouTube ( ) ! We've received over 20k downloads of the podcast and recorded a bunch more episodes along with the workshops this fall. Industry news and updates The 2023 edition of the State of JavaScript survey ( ) is now open. A few weeks ago, the creator of the Prettier code formatter put up a 10k bounty ( ) to any Rust -based project that could pass 95% of Prettier's test suite. The Biome toolchain, recently forked from the Rome project, has already succeeded in the challenge ( ) the competition in the code formatting space is now fully on. First we forgot about Dre, then we forgot about Angular.. or did we? Angular is back in a big way with Angular 17. ( ) v17 takes a leap forward in both features (e.g. hydration is now production ready) and vision with the team rebranding and repositioning it as a modern solution (there's a fancy new docs site ( ) too.) Note: We recently recorded a brand new updated Angular course with Mark from the Angular Team at Google. It will be out in early 2024! Here's some key releases you may want on your radar: Prettier 3.1 ( ) , Astro 4.0 ( ) , Vite 5.0 ( ) , and TypeScript 5.3 ( ). Handy tutorials and articles A Python developer has done a roundup of 'lightweight' JavaScript frameworks ( ) or systems that provide rich frontend experiences without using lots of JavaScript, including htmx, Phoenix LiveView, Alpine.js, and some Django-oriented options.

Learn DevOps Machine Learning with Python Free 3-hour course on MLOps,"Here are this week's five freeCodeCamp resources that are worth your time: 1. Machine Learning Operations or MLOps is an emerging field where developers use DevOps principles to build AI. You can learn all about it by coding along with this intermediate course. You'll use Python, Pandas, and several Machine Learning libraries such as ZenML. By the time you finish, you will have built and deployed your own production-grade AI project. (3 hour YouTube course): 3. There's a way to represent images with code, and I use it all the time. SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, and it's one of the most efficient ways to store images for icons or other simple patterns. It's so efficient because it stores the literal coordinates of all the lines and colors of your image. In this tutorial, freeCodeCamp contributor Hunor Mrton Borbly will teach you how to work with SVG files by coding your own Christmas tree, gingerbread man, and snowflake art. (30 minute read): 4. Remember that game Snake that came preloaded on all those indestructible Nokia phones? You're going to learn how to code that classic game where the snake keeps eating and getting longer until it collides with itself. Along the way, you'll get hands-on practice with JavaScript. You'll also learn how to give your game a retro design using HTML and CSS. (2 hour YouTube course): 5. Developers sometimes encode data as raw text using Base64, even though it takes up 33% more storage than binary. Why do they do this? Well, Base64 is just a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and two symbols: and /. Just to check my math, that's 26 26 10 2 64 characters, right? This tutorial will teach you all the things you never knew you wanted to know about Base64. And it will solve the mystery of why developers continue to use this even today. (25 minute read): Did you know that 10% of all donations to charities happen in the last 3 days of the year? There's no need to wait until the last minute, folks. You can donate to our charity today, and support our mission to create even more open learning resources. Join the 8,011 kind people who support us: Poem of the Week: Roses are red, Violets are blue, The Base64 of I love you, Is SSBsb3ZlIHlvdQ Netsecfocus on Twitter Until next week, happy coding. -- Quincy Larson Teacher and founder of freeCodeCamp.org If these aren't worth your time, you can turn them off:"

Learn Cloud Engineering Free 107-hour course on DevOps and AWS Cloud,"Here are this week's five freeCodeCamp resources that are worth your time: 1. The subject line wasn't a typo. freeCodeCamp really did just publish a 4-day-long course. This is a full cloud engineering bootcamp developed by my friend Andrew Brown. He's a former CTO who has passed every single cloud certification exam under the sun. This hands-on project-oriented course will teach you all about serverless architecture, containerization, databases, pipelines, and enterprise cloud strategies. Clear your calendar. (107 hour YouTube course): 2. Learn how to code your own Instagram clone. You're going to reverse engineer the entire app, using contemporary tools like React and Firebase. You'll learn about authentication, post creation, real-time interaction, and more. By the end of this course, you'll have built a sophisticated social media app from scratch. (8 hour YouTube course): 3. And if you want to focus on your fundamental programming skills, this tutorial is for you. Joan Ayebola explains JavaScript's famously tricky logic operators. She'll teach you about conditional statements that form the core of day-to-day programming. You'll also learn about Switch Statements, Short-Circuit Evaluation, the Ternary Operator, and how to apply these to real world projects. (20 minute read): 4. I hung out with hardware engineer Bruno Haid at his studio in NYC. We talked about his childhood in the European countryside, designing custom printed circuit boards, Retrocomputing, and founding companies in the US. It's a fun, breezy conversation. And we do philosophize a bit about Star Trek. (2 hour listen in your browser or favorite podcast app): 5. Tell your Spanish speaking friends that freeCodeCamp just published a comprehensive web development course, taught by software engineer and native speaker Manuel Basanta. You'll learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by coding along at home and building 7 projects. Over the years, freeCodeCamp has published many courses on these topics in English. And now we're proud to teach them in Spanish as well. (3 hour YouTube course): I hope you're excited about the holiday season. I just put up my Christmas tree and started listening to the Charlie Brown Christmas album. If you want to get into the holiday spirit as well, you can support our charity. The freeCodeCamp community is working hard to give the gift of open source learning. Join 8,011 kind people from around the world and start supporting our mission today: Quote of the Week: The cloud is just someone elses computer. Graham Cluley, Developer and Security Expert back in 2013 Until next week, happy coding. -- Quincy Larson Teacher and founder of freeCodeCamp.org"
